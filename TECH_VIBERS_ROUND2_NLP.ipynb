striking thirteen winston smith his chin nuzzled into hisbreast in an effort to escape the vile wind slipped quicklythrough the glass doors of victory mansions though notquickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with himthe hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats atone end of it a coloured poster too large for indoor displayhad been tacked to the wall it depicted simply an enormous face more than a metre wide the face of a man ofabout fortyfive with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features winston made for the stairs it wasno use trying the lift even at the best of times it was seldom working and at present the electric current was cutoff during daylight hours it was part of the economy drivein preparation for hate week the flat was seven flights upand winston who was thirtynine and had a varicose ulcerabove his right ankle went slowly resting several times onthe way on each landing opposite the liftshaft the posterwith the enormous face gazed from the wall it was one ofthose pictures which are so contrived that the eyes followyou about when you move big brother is watchingyou the caption beneath it raninside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figfree ebooks at planet ebookcom\u0018ures which had something to do with the production ofpigiron the voice came from an oblong metal plaque likea dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of therighthand wall winston turned a switch and the voicesank somewhat though the words were still distinguishable the instrument the telescreen it was called could bedimmed but there was no way of shutting it off completely he moved over to the window a smallish frail figurethe meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blueoveralls which were the uniform of the party his hair wasvery fair his face naturally sanguine his skin roughened bycoarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just endedoutside even through the shut windowpane the worldlooked cold down in the street little eddies of wind werewhirling dust and torn paper into spirals and though thesun was shining and the sky a harsh blue there seemedto be no

the overfulfilmentof the ninth threeyear plan the telescreen received andtransmitted simultaneously any sound that winston madeabove the level of a very low whisper would be picked up byit moreover so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded he could be seenas well as heard there was of course no way of knowingwhether you were being watched at any given moment howoften or on what system the thought police plugged in onany individual wire was guesswork it was even conceivablethat they watched everybody all the time but at any ratethey could plug in your wire

steel doors and hidden machinegunnests even the streets leading up to its outer barriers wereroamed by gorillafaced guards in black uniforms armedwith jointed truncheonswinston turned round abruptly he had set his featuresinto the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen he crossed theroom into the tiny kitchen by leaving the ministry at thistime of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen andhe was aware that there was no food in the kitchen excepta hunk of darkcoloured bread which had got to be savedfor tomorrows breakfast he took down from the shelf abottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label markedvictory gin it gave off a sickly oily smell as of chinesericespirit winston poured out nearly a teacupful nervedfree ebooks at planet ebookcom\u0018himself for a shock and gulped it down like a dose of medicineinstantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran outof his eyes the stuff was like nitric acid and moreover inswallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the backof the head with a rubber club the next moment howeverthe burning in his belly died down and the world began tolook more cheerful he took a cigarette from a crumpledpacket marked victory cigarettes and incautiouslyheld it upright whereupon the tobacco fell out on to thefloor with the next he was more successful he went backto the livingroom and sat down at a small table that stoodto the left of the telescreen from the table drawer he tookout a penholder a bottle of ink and a thick quartosizedblank book with a red back and a marbled coverfor some reason the telescreen in the livingroom was inan unusual position instead of being placed as was normalin the end wall where it could command the whole roomit was in the longer wall opposite the window to one sideof it there was a shallow alcove in which winston was nowsitting and which when the flats were built had probablybeen intended to hold bookshelves by sitting in the alcoveand keeping well back winston was able to remain outsidethe range of the telescreen so far as sight went he couldbe heard of course but so long as he stayed in his presentposition he could not be seen it was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thingthat he was now about to dobut it had also been suggested by the book that he had\u00181984just taken out of the drawer it was a peculiarly beautifulbook its smooth creamy paper a little yellowed by age wasof a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past he could guess however that the book wasmuch older than that he had seen it lying in the window ofa frowsy little junkshop in a slummy quarter of the townjust what quarter he did not now remember and had beenstricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possessit party members were supposed not to go into ordinaryshops dealing on the free market it was called but therule was not strictly kept because there were various thingssuch as shoelaces and razor blades which it was impossibleto get hold of in any other way he had given a quick glanceup and down the street and then had slipped inside andbought the book for two dollars fifty at the time he was notconscious of wanting it for any particular purpose he hadcarried it guiltily home in his briefcase even with nothingwritten in it it was a compromising possessionthe thing that he was about to do was to open a diarythis was not illegal nothing was illegal since there were nolonger any laws but if detected it was reasonably certainthat it would be punished by death or at least by twentyfive years in a forcedlabour camp winston fitted a nib intothe penholder and sucked it to get the grease off the penwas an archaic instrument seldom used even for signaturesand he had procured one furtively and with some difficultysimply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paperdeserved to be written on with a real nib instead of beingscratched with an inkpencil actually he was not used tofree ebooks at planet ebookcom\u0018writing by hand apart from very short notes it was usual to dictate everything into the speakwrite which was ofcourse impossible for his present purpose he dipped thepen into the ink and then faltered for just a second a tremor had gone through his bowels to mark the paper was thedecisive act in small clumsy letters he wroteapril 4th 1984he sat back a sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him to begin with he did not know with anycertainty that this was 1984 it must be round about thatdate since he was fairly sure that his age was thirtynineand he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945 butit was never possible nowadays to pin down any date withina year or twofor whom it suddenly occurred to him to wonder was hewriting this diary for the future for the unborn his mindhovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the pageand then fetched up with a bump against the newspeakword doublethink for the first time the magnitude ofwhat he had undertaken came home to him how could youcommunicate with the future it was of its nature impossible either the future would resemble the present in whichcase it would not listen to him or it would be different fromit and his predicament would be meaninglessfor some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper thetelescreen had changed over to strident military music itwas curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the pow101984er of expressing himself but even to have forgotten what itwas that he had originally intended to say for weeks pasthe had been making ready for this moment and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed exceptcourage the actual writing would be easy all he had todo was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head literally foryears at this moment however even the monologue haddried up moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itchingunbearably he dared not scratch it because if he did so italways became inflamed the seconds were ticking by hewas conscious of nothing except the blankness of the pagein front of him the itching of the skin above his ankle theblaring of the music and a slight booziness caused by theginsuddenly he began writing in sheer panic only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down his small butchildish handwriting straggled up and down the page shedding first its capital letters and finally even its full stopsapril 4th 1984 last night to the flicks all war films onevery good one of a ship full of refugees being bombedsomewhere in the mediterranean audience much amusedby shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away witha helicopter after him first you saw him wallowing alongin the water like a porpoise then you saw him through thehelicopters gunsights then he was full of holes and the searound him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as thoughthe holes had let in the water audience shouting with laughterfree ebooks at planet ebookcom11when he sank then you saw a lifeboat full of children with ahelicopter hovering over it there was a middleaged womanmight have been a jewess sitting up in the bow with a littleboy about three years old in her arms little boy screamingwith fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if hewas trying to burrow right into her and the woman puttingher arms round him and comforting him although she wasblue with fright herself all the time covering him up as muchas possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bulletsoff him then the helicopter planted a 20 kilo bomb in amongthem terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood thenthere was a wonderful shot of a childs arm going up up upright up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nosemust have followed it up and there was a lot of applause fromthe party seats but a woman down in the prole part of thehouse suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting theydidnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt itaint right not in front of kids it aint until the police turnedher turned her out i dont suppose anything happened to hernobody cares what the proles say typical prole reaction theynever——winston stopped writing partly because he was suffering from cramp he did not know what had made him pourout this stream of rubbish but the curious thing was thatwhile he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind to the point where he almost feltequal to writing it down it was he now realized becauseof this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come121984home and begin the diary todayit had happened that morning at the ministry if anything so nebulous could be said to happenit was nearly eleven hundred and in the records department where winston worked they were dragging thechairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen in preparation forthe two minutes hate winston was just taking his placein one of the middle rows when two people whom he knewby sight but had never spoken to came unexpectedly intothe room one of them was a girl whom he often passed inthe corridors he did not know her name but he knew thatshe worked in the fiction department presumably—sincehe had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying aspanner—she had some mechanical job on one of the novelwriting machines she was a boldlooking girl of abouttwentyseven with thick hair a freckled face and swiftathletic movements a narrow scarlet sash emblem of thejunior antisex league was wound several times roundthe waist of her overalls just tightly enough to bring out theshapeliness of her hips winston had disliked her from thevery first moment of seeing her he knew the reason it wasbecause of the atmosphere of hockeyfields and cold bathsand community hikes and general cleanmindedness whichshe managed to carry about with her he disliked nearly allwomen and especially the young and pretty ones it was always the women and above all the young ones who werethe most bigoted adherents of the party the swallowersof slogans the amateur spies and nosersout of unorthofree ebooks at planet ebookcom13doxy but this particular girl gave him the impression ofbeing more dangerous than most once when they passedin the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance whichseemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filledhim with black terror the idea had even crossed his mindthat she might be an agent of the thought police that itwas true was very unlikely still he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness which had fear mixed up in it as well ashostility whenever she was anywhere near himthe other person was a man named obrien a memberof the inner party and holder of some post so importantand remote that winston had only a dim idea of its naturea momentary hush passed over the group of people roundthe chairs as they saw the black overalls of an inner partymember approaching obrien was a large burly man witha thick neck and a coarse humorous brutal face in spite ofhis formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner he had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nosewhich was curiously disarming—in some indefinable waycuriously civilized it was a gesture which if anyone hadstill thought in such terms might have recalled an eighteenthcentury nobleman offering his snuffbox winstonhad seen obrien perhaps a dozen times in almost as manyyears he felt deeply drawn to him and not solely becausehe was intrigued by the contrast between obriens urbanemanner and his prizefighters physique much more it wasbecause of a secretly held belief—or perhaps not even a belief merely a hope—that obriens political orthodoxy wasnot perfect something in his face suggested it irresistibly141984and again perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that waswritten in his face but simply intelligence but at any ratehe had the appearance of being a person that you couldtalk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and gethim alone winston had never made the smallest effort toverify this guess indeed there was no way of doing so atthis moment obrien glanced at his wristwatch saw that itwas nearly eleven hundred and evidently decided to stay inthe records department until the two minutes hate wasover he took a chair in the same row as winston a coupleof places away a small sandyhaired woman who workedin the next cubicle to winston was between them the girlwith dark hair was sitting immediately behindthe next moment a hideous grinding speech as of somemonstrous machine running without oil burst from thebig telescreen at the end of the room it was a noise that setones teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of onesneck the hate had startedas usual the face of emmanuel goldstein the enemy ofthe people had flashed on to the screen there were hisseshere and there among the audience the little sandyhairedwoman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once long agohow long ago nobody quite remembered had been one ofthe leading figures of the party almost on a level with bigbrother himself and then had engaged in counterrevolutionary activities had been condemned to death and hadmysteriously escaped and disappeared the programmes ofthe two minutes hate varied from day to day but there wasfree ebooks at planet ebookcom15none in which goldstein was not the principal figure hewas the primal traitor the earliest defiler of the partys purity all subsequent crimes against the party all treacheriesacts of sabotage heresies deviations sprang directly outof his teaching somewhere or other he was still alive andhatching his conspiracies perhaps somewhere beyond thesea under the protection of his foreign paymasters perhapseven—so it was occasionally rumoured—in some hidingplace in oceania itselfwinstons diaphragm was constricted he could neversee the face of goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions it was a lean jewish face with a great fuzzy aureole ofwhite hair and a small goatee beard—a clever face and yetsomehow inherently despicable with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose near the end of which a pairof spectacles was perched it resembled the face of a sheepand the voice too had a sheeplike quality goldstein wasdelivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrinesof the party—an attack so exaggerated and perverse that achild should have been able to see through it and yet justplausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling thatother people less levelheaded than oneself might be takenin by it he was abusing big brother he was denouncingthe dictatorship of the party he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with eurasia he was advocatingfreedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of thought he was crying hysterically thatthe revolution had been betrayed—and all this in rapidpolysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the ha161984bitual style of the orators of the party and even containednewspeak words more newspeak words indeed than anyparty member would normally use in real life and all thewhile lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality whichgoldsteins specious claptrap covered behind his head onthe telescreen there marched the endless columns of theeurasian army—row after row of solidlooking men withexpressionless asiatic faces who swam up to the surfaceof the screen and vanished to be replaced by others exactly similar the dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers bootsformed the background to goldsteins bleating voicebefore the hate had proceeded for thirty seconds uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from halfthe people in the room the selfsatisfied sheeplike face onthe screen and the terrifying power of the eurasian armybehind it were too much to be borne besides the sight oreven the thought of goldstein produced fear and anger automatically he was an object of hatred more constant thaneither eurasia or eastasia since when oceania was at warwith one of these powers it was generally at peace with theother but what was strange was that although goldsteinwas hated and despised by everybody although every dayand a thousand times a day on platforms on the telescreenin newspapers in books his theories were refuted smashedridiculed held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were—in spite of all this his influence neverseemed to grow less always there were fresh dupes waitingto be seduced by him a day never passed when spies andsaboteurs acting under his directions were not unmaskedfree ebooks at planet ebookcom17by the thought police he was the commander of a vastshadowy army an underground network of conspiratorsdedicated to the overthrow of the state the brotherhoodits name was supposed to be there were also whisperedstories of a terrible book a compendium of all the heresiesof which goldstein was the author and which circulatedclandestinely here and there it was a book without a titlepeople referred to it if at all simply as the book but oneknew of such things only through vague rumours neitherthe brotherhood nor the book was a subject that any ordinary party member would mention if there was a way ofavoiding itin its second minute the hate rose to a frenzy peoplewere leaping up and down in their places and shoutingat the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen thelittle sandyhaired woman had turned bright pink andher mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landedfish even obriens heavy face was flushed he was sittingvery straight in his chair his powerful chest swelling andquivering as though he were standing up to the assault of awave the darkhaired girl behind winston had begun crying out swine swine swine and suddenly she picked upa heavy newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen itstruck goldsteins nose and bounced off the voice continued inexorably in a lucid moment winston found that hewas shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair the horrible thing aboutthe two minutes hate was not that one was obliged to act181984a part but on the contrary that it was impossible to avoidjoining in within thirty seconds any pretence was alwaysunnecessary a hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictivenessa desire to kill to torture to smash faces in with a sledgehammer seemed to flow through the whole group of peoplelike an electric current turning one even against ones willinto a grimacing screaming lunatic and yet the rage thatone felt was an abstract undirected emotion which couldbe switched from one object to another like the flame of ablowlamp thus at one moment winstons hatred was notturned against goldstein at all but on the contrary againstbig brother the party and the thought police and at suchmoments his heart went out to the lonely derided hereticon the screen sole guardian of truth and sanity in a worldof lies and yet the very next instant he was at one with thepeople about him and all that was said of goldstein seemedto him to be true at those moments his secret loathing ofbig brother changed into adoration and big brother seemedto tower up an invincible fearless protector standing likea rock against the hordes of asia and goldstein in spiteof his isolation his helplessness and the doubt that hungabout his very existence seemed like some sinister enchanter capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking thestructure of civilizationit was even possible at moments to switch ones hatred this way or that by a voluntary act suddenly by thesort of violent effort with which one wrenches ones headaway from the pillow in a nightmare winston succeededin transferring his hatred from the face on the screen tofree ebooks at planet ebookcom19the darkhaired girl behind him vivid beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind he would flog her to deathwith a rubber truncheon he would tie her naked to a stakeand shoot her full of arrows like saint sebastian he wouldravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax better than before moreover he realized why it was that hehated her he hated her because she was young and prettyand sexless because he wanted to go to bed with her andwould never do so because round her sweet supple waistwhich seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm therewas only the odious scarlet sash aggressive symbol of chastitythe hate rose to its climax the voice of goldstein hadbecome an actual sheeps bleat and for an instant the facechanged into that of a sheep then the sheepface melted intothe figure of a eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancinghuge and terrible his submachine gun roaring and seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen so that someof the people in the front row actually flinched backwardsin their seats but in the same moment drawing a deep sighof relief from everybody the hostile figure melted into theface of big brother blackhaired blackmoustachiod fullof power and mysterious calm and so vast that it almostfilled up the screen nobody heard what big brother wassaying it was merely a few words of encouragement thesort of words that are uttered in the din of battle not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the factof being spoken then the face of big brother faded awayagain and instead the three slogans of the party stood out201984in bold capitalswar is peacefreedom is slaveryignorance is strengthbut the face of big brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen as though the impact that it hadmade on everyones eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately the little sandyhaired woman had flung herselfforward over the back of the chair in front of her with atremulous murmur that sounded like my saviour she extended her arms towards the screen then she buried herface in her hands it was apparent that she was uttering aprayerat this moment the entire group of people broke into adeep slow rhythmical chant of bbbb—over and overagain very slowly with a long pause between the first band the second—a heavy murmurous sound somehowcuriously savage in the background of which one seemedto hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tomtoms for perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept itup it was a refrain that was often heard in moments ofoverwhelming emotion partly it was a sort of hymn to thewisdom and majesty of big brother but still more it wasan act of selfhypnosis a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise winstons entrails seemedto grow cold in the two minutes hate he could not helpsharing in the general delirium but this subhuman chantfree ebooks at planet ebookcom21ing of bbbb always filled him with horror of coursehe chanted with the rest it was impossible to do otherwiseto dissemble your feelings to control your face to do whateveryone else was doing was an instinctive reaction butthere was a space of a couple of seconds during which theexpression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed himand it was exactly at this moment that the significant thinghappened—if indeed it did happenmomentarily he caught obriens eye obrien had stoodup he had taken off his spectacles and was in the act ofresettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesturebut there was a fraction of a second when their eyes metand for as long as it took to happen winston knew—yes heknew—that obrien was thinking the same thing as himself an unmistakable message had passed it was as thoughtheir two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowingfrom one into the other through their eyes i am with youobrien seemed to be saying to him i know precisely whatyou are feeling i know all about your contempt your hatred your disgust but dont worry i am on your side andthen the flash of intelligence was gone and obriens facewas as inscrutable as everybody elsesthat was all and he was already uncertain whether it hadhappened such incidents never had any sequel all that theydid was to keep alive in him the belief or hope that others besides himself were the enemies of the party perhapsthe rumours of vast underground conspiracies were trueafter all—perhaps the brotherhood really existed it wasimpossible in spite of the endless arrests and confessions221984and executions to be sure that the brotherhood was notsimply a myth some days he believed in it some days notthere was no evidence only fleeting glimpses that mightmean anything or nothing snatches of overheard conversation faint scribbles on lavatory walls—once even whentwo strangers met a small movement of the hand whichhad looked as though it might be a signal of recognition itwas all guesswork very likely he had imagined everythinghe had gone back to his cubicle without looking at obrienagain the idea of following up their momentary contacthardly crossed his mind it would have been inconceivablydangerous even if he had known how to set about doing itfor a second two seconds they had exchanged an equivocal glance and that was the end of the story but even thatwas a memorable event in the locked loneliness in whichone had to livewinston roused himself and sat up straighter he let outa belch the gin was rising from his stomachhis eyes refocused on the page he discovered thatwhile he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing asthough by automatic action and it was no longer the samecramped awkward handwriting as before his pen had slidvoluptuously over the smooth paper printing in large neatcapitals—down with big brother down withbig brother down with big brother downwith big brother down with big brotherover and over again filling half a pagehe could not help feeling a twinge of panic it was absurd since the writing of those particular words was notfree ebooks at planet ebookcom23more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diarybut for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiledpages and abandon the enterprise altogetherhe did not do so however because he knew that it wasuseless whether he wrote down with big brotheror whether he refrained from writing it made no difference whether he went on with the diary or whether he didnot go on with it made no difference the thought policewould get him just the same he had committed—wouldstill have committed even if he had never set pen to paper—the essential crime that contained all others in itselfthoughtcrime they called it thoughtcrime was not a thingthat could be concealed for ever you might dodge successfully for a while even for years but sooner or later theywere bound to get youit was always at night—the arrests invariably happenedat night the sudden jerk out of sleep the rough hand shaking your shoulder the lights glaring in your eyes the ring ofhard faces round the bed in the vast majority of cases therewas no trial no report of the arrest people simply disappeared always during the night your name was removedfrom the registers every record of everything you had everdone was wiped out your onetime existence was deniedand then forgotten you were abolished annihilated vaporized was the usual wordfor a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria he began writing in a hurried untidy scrawltheyll shoot me i dont care theyll shoot me in the back of the241984neck i dont care down with big brother they always shoot youin the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother——he sat back in his chair slightly ashamed of himself andlaid down the pen the next moment he started violentlythere was a knocking at the dooralready he sat as still as a mouse in the futile hope thatwhoever it was might go away after a single attempt but nothe knocking was repeated the worst thing of all would beto delay his heart was thumping like a drum but his facefrom long habit was probably expressionless he got up andmoved heavily towards the doorfree ebooks at planet ebookcom25chapter 2as he put his hand to the doorknob winston saw thathe had left the diary open on the table down withbig brother was written all over it in letters almost bigenough to be legible across the room it was an inconceivably stupid thing to have done but he realized even in hispanic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper byshutting the book while the ink was wethe drew in his breath and opened the door instantlya warm wave of relief flowed through him a colourlesscrushedlooking woman with wispy hair and a lined facewas standing outsideoh comrade she began in a dreary whining sort ofvoice i thought i heard you come in do you think youcould come across and have a look at our kitchen sink itsgot blocked up and——it was mrs parsons the wife of a neighbour on the samefloor mrs was a word somewhat discountenanced by theparty—you were supposed to call everyone comrade—but with some women one used it instinctively she wasa woman of about thirty but looking much older one hadthe impression that there was dust in the creases of her facewinston followed her down the passage these amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation victory mansionswere old flats built in 1930 or thereabouts and were falling261984to

table there wasa litter of dirty dishes and dogeared exercisebooks onthe walls were scarlet banners of the youth league and thespies and a fullsized poster of big brother there was theusual boiledcabbage smell common to the whole buildingbut it was shot through by a sharper reek of sweat which—one knew this at the first sniff though it was hard to sayhow—was the sweat of some person not present at the moment in another room someone with a comb and a piece oftoilet paper was trying to keep tune with the military musicwhich was still issuing from the telescreenits the children said mrs

imitatingfree ebooks at planet ebookcom29her brother in every movement it was somehow slightlyfrightening like the gambolling of tiger cubs which willsoon grow up into maneaters there was a sort of calculating ferocity in the boys eye a quite evident desire to hit orkick winston and a consciousness of being very nearly bigenough to do so it was a good job it was not a real pistol hewas holding

in the park that evening winston rememberedthis happened about once a month and was a popular spectacle children always clamoured to be taken to see it hetook his leave of mrs parsons and made for the door but hehad not gone six steps down the passage when somethinghit the back of his neck an agonizingly painful blow it wasas though a redhot wire had been jabbed into him he spunround just in time to see mrs parsons dragging her son backinto the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult301984goldstein bellowed the boy as the door closed on himbut what most struck winston was the look of helplessfright on the womans greyish faceback in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreenand sat down at the table again still rubbing his neck themusic from the telescreen had stopped instead a clippedmilitary voice was reading out with a sort of brutal relisha description of the armaments of the new floating fortress which had just been anchored between iceland andthe faroe lslandswith those children he thought that wretched woman must lead a life of terror another year two years andthey would be watching her night and day for symptoms ofunorthodoxy nearly all children nowadays were horriblewhat was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the spies they were systematically turned intoungovernable little savages and yet this produced in themno tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of theparty on the contrary they adored the party and everything connected with it the songs the processions thebanners the hiking the drilling with dummy rifles theyelling of slogans the worship of big brother—it was all asort of glorious game to them all their ferocity was turnedoutwards against the enemies of the state against foreigners traitors saboteurs

policethe sting of the catapult bullet had worn off he pickedup his pen halfheartedly wondering whether he could findsomething more to write in the diary suddenly he beganthinking of obrien againyears ago—how long was it seven years it must be—hehad dreamed that he was walking through a pitchdarkroom and someone sitting to one side of him had said ashe passed we shall meet in the place where there is nodarkness it was said very quietly almost casually—a statement not a command he had walked on without pausingwhat was curious was that at the time in the dream thewords had not made much impression on him it was onlylater and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance he could not now remember whether it was beforeor after having the dream that he had seen obrien for thefirst time nor could he remember when he had first identified the voice as obriens but at any rate the identificationexisted it was obrien who had spoken to him out of thedarkwinston had never been able to feel sure—even after thismornings flash of the eyes it was still impossible to be surewhether obrien was a friend or an enemy nor did it evenseem to matter greatly there was a link of understandingbetween them more important than affection or partisanship we shall meet in the place where there is no darknesshe had said winston did not know what it meant only thatin some way or another it would come true321984the voice from the telescreen paused a trumpet callclear and beautiful floated into the stagnant air the voicecontinued raspinglyattention your attention please a

hepicked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and deposited it on the corner of the cover where it was bound to beshaken off if the book was moved361984chapter 3winston was dreaming of his motherhe must he thought have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had disappeared she wasa tall statuesque rather silent woman with slow movements and magnificent fair hair his father he rememberedmore vaguely as dark and thin dressed always in neat darkclothes winston remembered especially the very thin solesof his fathers shoes and wearing spectacles the two ofthem must evidently have been swallowed up in one of thefirst great purges of the fiftiesat this moment his mother was sitting in some placedeep down beneath him with his young sister in her armshe did not remember his sister at all except as a tiny feeblebaby always silent with large watchful eyes both of themwere looking up at him they were down in some subterranean place—the bottom of a well for instance or a verydeep grave—but it was a place which already far below himwas itself moving downwards they were in the saloon ofa sinking ship looking up at him through the darkeningwater there was still air in the saloon they could still seehim and he them but all the while they were sinking downdown into the green waters which in another moment musthide them from sight for ever he was out in the light andair while they were being sucked down to death and theyfree ebooks at planet ebookcom37were down there because he was up here he knew it andthey knew it and he could see the knowledge in their facesthere was no reproach either in their faces or in their heartsonly the knowledge that they must die in order that hemight remain alive and that this was part of the unavoidable order of thingshe could not remember what had happened but he knewin his dream that in some way the lives of his mother andhis sister had been sacrificed to his own it was one of thosedreams which while retaining the characteristic dreamscenery are a continuation of ones intellectual life andin which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which stillseem new and valuable after one is awake the thing thatnow suddenly struck winston was that his mothers deathnearly thirty years ago had been tragic and sorrowful in away that was no longer possible tragedy he perceived belonged to the ancient time to a time when there was stillprivacy love and friendship and when the members of afamily stood by one another without needing to know thereason his mothers memory tore at his heart because shehad died loving him when he was too young and selfishto love her in return and because somehow he did not remember how she had sacrificed herself to a conception ofloyalty that was private and unalterable such things hesaw could not happen today today there were fear hatredand pain but no dignity of emotion no deep or complexsorrows all this he seemed to see in the large eyes of hismother and his sister looking up at him through the greenwater hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking381984suddenly he was standing on short springy turf on asummer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gildedthe ground the landscape that he was looking at recurredso often in his dreams that he was never fully certainwhether or not he had seen it in the real world in his waking thoughts he called it the golden country it was an oldrabbitbitten pasture with a foottrack wandering across itand a molehill here and there in the ragged hedge on theopposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees wereswaying very faintly in the breeze their leaves just stirringin dense masses like womens hair somewhere near at handthough out of sight there was a clear slowmoving streamwhere dace were swimming in the pools under the willowtreesthe girl with dark hair was coming towards them acrossthe field with what seemed a single movement she tore offher clothes and flung them disdainfully aside her bodywas white and smooth but it aroused no desire in him indeed he barely looked at it what overwhelmed him in thatinstant was admiration for the gesture with which she hadthrown her clothes aside with its grace and carelessnessit seemed to annihilate a whole culture a whole systemof thought as though big brother and the party and thethought police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm that too was a gesturebelonging to the ancient time winston woke up with theword shakespeare on his lipsthe telescreen was giving forth an earsplitting whistlewhich continued on the same note for thirty seconds itfree ebooks at planet ebookcom39was nought seven fifteen gettingup time for office workerswinston wrenched his body out of bed—naked for a member of the outer party received only 3000 clothing couponsannually and a suit of pyjamas was 600—and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chairthe physical jerks would begin in three minutes the nextmoment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit whichnearly always attacked him soon after waking up it emptiedhis lungs so completely that he could only begin breathingagain by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gaspshis veins had swelled with the effort of the cough and thevaricose ulcer had started itchingthirty to forty group yapped a piercing female voicethirty to forty

already appearedarms bending and stretching she rapped out takeyour time by me one two three four one two threefour come on comrades put a bit of life into it one twothree four one two three fourthe pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out ofwinstons mind the impression made by his dream and therhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhatas he mechanically shot his arms back and forth wearingon his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during the physical jerks he was struggling401984to think his way backward into the dim period of his earlychildhood it was extraordinarily difficult beyond the latefifties everything faded when there were no external records that you could refer to even the outline of your ownlife lost its sharpness you remembered huge events whichhad quite probably not happened you remembered thedetail of incidents without being able to recapture their atmosphere and there were long blank periods to which youcould assign nothing everything had been different theneven the names of countries and their shapes on the maphad been different airstrip one for instance had not beenso called in those days it had been called england or britain though london he felt fairly certain had always beencalled londonwinston could not definitely remember a time when hiscountry had not been at war but it was evident that therehad been a fairly long interval of peace during his childhood because one of his early memories was of an air raidwhich appeared to take everyone by surprise perhaps it wasthe time when the atomic bomb had fallen on colchesterhe did not remember the raid itself but he did rememberhis fathers hand clutching his own as they hurried downdown down into some place deep in the earth round andround a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and whichfinally so wearied his legs that he began whimpering andthey had to stop and rest his mother in her slow dreamyway was following a long way behind them she was carrying his baby sister—or perhaps it was only a bundle ofblankets that she was carrying he was not certain whetherfree ebooks at planet ebookcom41his sister had been born then finally they had emerged intoa noisy crowded place which he had realized to be a tubestationthere were people sitting all over the stoneflagged floorand other people packed tightly together were sitting onmetal bunks one above the other winston and his motherand father found themselves a place on the floor and nearthem an old man and an old woman were sitting side byside on a bunk the old man had on a decent dark suit anda black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair hisface was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears hereeked of gin it seemed to breathe out of his skin in placeof sweat and one could have fancied that the tears wellingfrom his eyes were pure gin but though slightly drunk hewas also suffering under some grief that was genuine andunbearable in his childish way winston grasped that someterrible thing something that was beyond forgiveness andcould never be remedied had just happened it also seemedto him that he knew what it was someone whom the oldman loved—a little granddaughter perhaps—had beenkilled every few minutes the old man kept repeatingwe didnt ought to ave trusted em i said so ma didnt ithats what comes of trusting em i said so all along wedidnt ought to ave trusted the buggersbut which buggers they didnt ought to have trustedwinston could not now remembersince about that time war had been literally continu421984ous though strictly speaking it had not always been thesame war for several months during his childhood therehad been confused street fighting in london itself some ofwhich he remembered vividly but to trace out the historyof the whole period to say who was fighting whom at anygiven moment would have been utterly impossible sinceno written record and no spoken word ever made mentionof any other alignment than the existing one at this moment for example in 1984 if it was 1984 oceania was atwar with eurasia and in alliance with eastasia in no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the threepowers had at any time been grouped along different linesactually as winston well knew it was only four years sinceoceania had been at war with eastasia and in alliance witheurasia but that was merely a piece of furtive knowledgewhich he happened to possess because his memory was notsatisfactorily under control officially the change of partners had never happened oceania was at war with eurasiatherefore oceania had always been at war with eurasia theenemy of the moment always represented absolute evil andit followed that any past or future agreement with him wasimpossiblethe frightening thing he reflected for the ten thousandth time as he forced his shoulders painfully backwardwith hands on hips they were gyrating their bodies fromthe waist an exercise that was supposed to be good for theback muscles—the frightening thing was that it might allbe true if the party could thrust its hand into the past andsay of this or that event it never happened—thatfree ebooks at planet ebookcom43surely was more terrifying than mere torture and deaththe party said that oceania had never been in alliancewith eurasia he winston smith knew that oceania hadbeen in alliance with eurasia as short a time as four yearsago but where did that knowledge exist only in his ownconsciousness which in any case must soon be annihilatedand if all others accepted the lie which the party imposed—if all records told the same tale—then the lie passed intohistory and became truth who controls the past ran theparty slogan controls the future who controls the presentcontrols the past and yet the past though of its nature alterable never had been altered whatever was true now wastrue from everlasting to everlasting it was quite simple allthat was needed was an unending series of victories overyour own memory reality control they called it in newspeak doublethinkstand easy barked the instructress a little more geniallywinston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilledhis lungs with air his mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink to know and not to know tobe conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies to hold simultaneously two opinionswhich cancelled out knowing them to be contradictoryand believing in both of them to use logic against logicto repudiate morality while laying claim to it to believethat democracy was impossible and that the party was theguardian of democracy to forget whatever it was necessaryto forget then to draw it back into memory again at the441984moment when it was needed and then promptly to forgetit again and above all to apply the same process to the process itself that was the ultimate subtlety consciously toinduce unconsciousness and then once again to becomeunconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performedeven to understand the word doublethink involved theuse of doublethinkthe instructress had called them to attention again andnow lets see which of us can touch our toes she said enthusiastically right over from the hips please comradesonetwo onetwowinston loathed this exercise which sent shooting painsall the way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended bybringing on another coughing fit the halfpleasant quality went out of his meditations the past he reflected hadnot merely been altered it had been actually destroyed forhow could you establish even the most obvious fact whenthere existed no record outside your own memory he triedto remember in what year he had first heard mention ofbig brother he thought it must have been at some time inthe sixties but it was impossible to be certain in the partyhistories of course big brother figured as the leader andguardian of the revolution since its very earliest days hisexploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time untilalready they extended into the fabulous world of the fortiesand the thirties when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of london in greatgleaming motorcars or horse carriages with glass sidesthere was no knowing how much of this legend was truefree ebooks at planet ebookcom45and how much invented winston could not even remember at what date the party itself had come into existence hedid not believe he had ever heard the word ingsoc before1960 but it was possible that in its oldspeak form—english socialism that is to say—it had been current earliereverything melted into mist sometimes indeed you couldput your finger on a definite lie it was not true for exampleas was claimed in the party history books that the partyhad invented aeroplanes he remembered aeroplanes sincehis earliest childhood but you could prove nothing therewas never any evidence just once in his whole life he hadheld in his hands unmistakable

first time in several yearsfree ebooks at planet ebookcom47chapter 4with the deep unconscious sigh which not even thenearness of the telescreen could prevent him fromuttering when his days work started winston pulled thespeakwrite towards him blew the dust from its mouthpieceand put on his spectacles then he unrolled and clippedtogether four small cylinders of paper which had alreadyflopped out of the pneumatic tube on the righthand sideof his deskin the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices tothe right of the speakwrite a small pneumatic tube for written messages to the left a larger one for newspapers and inthe side wall within easy reach of winstons arm a largeoblong slit protected by a wire grating this last was for thedisposal of waste paper similar slits existed in thousands ortens of thousands throughout the building not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor for somereason they were nicknamed memory holes when oneknew that any document was due for destruction or evenwhen one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about it was anautomatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory holeand drop it in whereupon it would be whirled away on acurrent of warm air to the enormous furnaces which werehidden somewhere in the recesses of the buildingwinston examined the four slips of paper which he had481984unrolled each contained a message of only one or two linesin the abbreviated jargon—not actually newspeak but consisting largely of newspeak words—which was used in theministry for internal purposes they rantimes 17384 bb speech

other three were routine matters though the second one would probably meansome tedious wading through lists of figureswinston dialled back numbers on the telescreen andcalled for the appropriate issues of the times which slidout of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes delaythe messages he had received referred to articles or newsitems which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter or as the official phrase had it to rectify forexample it appeared from the times of the seventeenthof march that big brother in his speech of the previousday had predicted that the south indian front would remain quiet but that a eurasian offensive would shortly befree ebooks at planet ebookcom49launched in north africa as it happened the eurasianhigher command had launched its offensive in south india and left north africa alone it was therefore necessaryto rewrite a paragraph of big brothers speech in such away as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened or again the times of the nineteenth of decemberhad published the official forecasts of the output of variousclasses of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of 1983which was also the sixth quarter of the ninth threeyearplan todays issue contained a statement of the actual output from which it appeared that the forecasts were in everyinstance grossly wrong winstons job was to rectify theoriginal figures by making them agree with the later onesas for the third message it referred to a very simple errorwhich could be set right in a couple of minutes as short atime ago as february the ministry of plenty had issued apromise a categorical pledge were the official words thatthere would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during1984 actually as winston was aware the chocolate rationwas to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the endof the present week all that was needed was to substitutefor the original promise a warning that it would probablybe necessary to reduce the ration at some time in aprilas soon as winston had dealt with each of the messageshe clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriatecopy of the times and pushed them into the pneumatictube then with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious he crumpled up the original message andany notes that he himself had made and dropped them into501984the memory hole to be devoured by the flameswhat happened in the unseen labyrinth to which thepneumatic tubes led he did not know in detail but he didknow in general terms as soon as all the corrections whichhappened to be necessary in any particular number of thetimes had been assembled and collated that number wouldbe reprinted the original copy destroyed and the correctedcopy placed on the files in its stead this process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers butto books periodicals pamphlets posters leaflets filmssoundtracks cartoons photographs—to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably holdany political or ideological significance day by day andalmost minute by minute the past was brought up to datein this way every prediction made by the party could beshown by documentary evidence to have been correct norwas any item of news or any expression of opinion whichconflicted with the needs of the moment ever allowed toremain on record all history was a palimpsest scrapedclean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary inno case would it have been possible once the deed was doneto prove that any falsification had taken place the largestsection of the records department far larger than the oneon which winston worked consisted simply of personswhose duty it was to track down and collect all copies ofbooks newspapers and other documents which had beensuperseded and were due for destruction a number of thetimes which might because of changes in political alignment or mistaken prophecies uttered by big brother havefree ebooks at planet ebookcom51been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearingits original date and no other copy existed to contradict itbooks also were recalled and rewritten again and againand were invariably reissued without any admission thatany alteration had been made even the written instructions which winston received and which he invariably gotrid of as soon as he had dealt with them never stated orimplied that an act of forgery was to be committed alwaysthe reference was to slips errors misprints or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests ofaccuracybut actually he thought as he readjusted the ministryof plentys figures it was not even forgery it was merely thesubstitution of one piece of nonsense for another most ofthe material that you were dealing with had no connexionwith anything in the real world not even the kind of connexion that is contained in a direct lie statistics were justas much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version a great deal of the time you were expected tomake them up out of your head for example the ministry of plentys forecast had estimated the output of bootsfor the quarter at 145 million pairs the actual output wasgiven as sixtytwo millions winston however in rewritingthe forecast marked the figure down to fiftyseven millionsso as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had beenoverfulfilled in any case sixtytwo millions was no nearer the truth than fiftyseven millions or than 145 millionsvery likely no boots had been produced at all likelier stillnobody knew how many had been produced much less521984cared all one knew was that every quarter astronomicalnumbers of boots were produced on paper while perhapshalf the population of oceania went barefoot and so it waswith every class of recorded fact great or small everythingfaded away into a shadowworld in which finally even thedate of the year had become uncertainwinston glanced across the hall in the correspondingcubicle on the other side a small preciselooking darkchinned man named tillotson was working steadily awaywith a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth veryclose to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite he had the air oftrying to keep what he was saying a secret between himselfand the telescreen he looked up and his spectacles darteda hostile flash in winstons directionwinston hardly knew tillotson and had no idea whatwork he was employed on people in the records department did not readily talk about their jobs in the longwindowless hall with its double row of cubicles and its endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring intospeakwrites there were quite a dozen people whom winston did not even know by name though he daily saw themhurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in thetwo minutes hate he knew that in the cubicle next to himthe little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out simply at tracking down and deleting from the press the namesof people who had been vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed there was a certain fitness inthis since her own husband had been vaporized a coupleof years earlier and a few

unimaginable multitude of jobsthere were the huge printingshops with their subeditorstheir typography experts and their elaborately equippedstudios for the faking of photographs there was the teleprogrammes section with its engineers its producers andits teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices there were the armies of reference clerks whosejob was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicalswhich were due for recall there were the vast repositorieswhere the corrected documents were stored and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were destroyed andsomewhere or other quite anonymous there were the directing brains who coordinated the whole effort and laiddown the lines of policy which made it necessary that thisfragment of the past

reconstruct the past but to supply the citizensof oceania with newspapers films textbooks telescreen541984programmes plays novels—with every conceivable kind ofinformation instruction or entertainment from a statue toa slogan from a lyric poem to a biological treatise and froma childs spellingbook to a newspeak dictionary and theministry had not only to supply the multifarious needs ofthe party but also to repeat the whole operation at a lowerlevel for the benefit of the proletariat there was a wholechain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature music drama and entertainment generally herewere produced rubbishy newspapers containing almostnothing except sport crime and astrology sensationalfivecent novelettes films oozing with sex and sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanicalmeans on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator there was even a whole subsection—pornosec itwas called in newspeak—engaged in producing the lowestkind of pornography which was sent out in sealed packetsand which no party member other than those who workedon it was permitted to look atthree messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube whilewinston was working but they were simple matters andhe had disposed of them before the two minutes hate interrupted him when the hate was over he returned tohis cubicle took the newspeak dictionary from the shelfpushed the speakwrite to one side cleaned his spectaclesand settled down to his main job of the morningwinstons greatest pleasure in life was in his work mostof it was a tedious routine but included in it there were alsojobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself infree ebooks at planet ebookcom55them as in the depths of a mathematical problem—delicatepieces of forgery in which you had nothing to guide youexcept your knowledge of the principles of ingsoc and yourestimate of what the party wanted you to say winston wasgood at this kind of thing on occasion he had even beenentrusted with the rectification of the times leading articles which were written entirely in newspeak he unrolledthe message that he had set aside earlier it rantimes 31283 reporting bb

3rd 1983 is extremely unsatisfactory and makesreferences to nonexistent persons rewrite it in full andsubmit your draft to higher authority before filingwinston read through the offending article big brothers order for the day it seemed had been chiefly devotedto praising the work of an organization known as ffccwhich supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailorsin the floating fortresses a certain comrade withers aprominent member of the inner party had been singled outfor special mention and awarded a decoration the order ofconspicuous merit second classthree months later ffcc had suddenly been dissolved561984with no reasons given one could assume that withers andhis associates were now in disgrace but there had been noreport of the matter in the press or on the telescreen thatwas to be expected since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced the greatpurges involving thousands of people with public trials oftraitors and thoughtcriminals who made abject confessionof their crimes and were afterwards executed were specialshowpieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple ofyears more commonly people who had incurred the displeasure of the party simply disappeared and were neverheard of again one never had the smallest clue as to whathad happened to them in some cases they might not evenbe dead perhaps thirty people personally known to winston not counting his parents had disappeared at one timeor anotherwinston stroked his nose gently with a paperclip in thecubicle across the way comrade tillotson was still crouching secretively over his speakwrite he raised his head fora moment again the hostile spectacleflash winston wondered whether comrade tillotson was engaged on the samejob as himself it was perfectly possible so tricky a piece ofwork would never be entrusted to a single person on theother hand to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place verylikely as many as a dozen people were now working awayon rival versions of what big brother had actually said andpresently some master brain in the inner party would select this version or that would reedit it and set in motionfree ebooks at planet ebookcom57the complex processes of crossreferencing that would berequired and then the chosen lie would pass into the permanent records and become truthwinston did not know why withers had been disgracedperhaps it was for corruption or incompetence perhaps bigbrother was merely getting rid of a toopopular subordinate perhaps withers or someone close to him had beensuspected of heretical tendencies or perhaps—what waslikeliest of all—the thing had simply happened becausepurges and vaporizations were a necessary part of the mechanics of government the only real clue lay in the wordsrefs unpersons which indicated that withers was alreadydead you could not invariably assume this to be the casewhen people were arrested sometimes they were releasedand allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year ortwo years before being executed very occasionally someperson whom you had believed dead long since would makea ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he wouldimplicate hundreds of others by his testimony before vanishing this time for ever withers however was already anunperson he did not exist he had never existed winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reversethe tendency of big brothers speech it was better to makeit deal with something totally unconnected with its original subjecthe might turn the speech into the usual denunciation oftraitors and thoughtcriminals but that was a little too obvious while to invent a victory at the front or some triumphof overproduction in the ninth threeyear plan might581984complicate the records too much what was needed was apiece of pure fantasy suddenly there sprang into his mindready made as it were the image of a certain comrade ogilvy who had recently died in battle in heroic circumstancesthere were occasions when big brother devoted his orderfor the day to commemorating some humble rankandfileparty member whose life and death he held up as an example worthy to be followed today he should commemoratecomrade ogilvy it was true that there was no such personas comrade ogilvy but a few lines of print and a couple offaked photographs would soon bring him into existencewinston thought for a moment then pulled the speakwrite towards him and began dictating in big brothersfamiliar style a style at once military and pedantic andbecause of a trick of asking questions and then promptlyanswering them what lessons do we learn from this factcomrades the lesson—which is also one of the fundamental principles of ingsoc—that etc etc easy to imitateat the age of three comrade ogilvy had refused all toysexcept a drum a submachine gun and a model helicopterat six—a year early by a special relaxation of the rules—hehad joined the spies at nine he had been a troop leader ateleven he had denounced his uncle to the thought policeafter overhearing a conversation which appeared to him tohave criminal tendencies at seventeen he had been a district organizer of the junior antisex league at nineteenhe had designed a handgrenade which had been adoptedby the ministry of peace and which at its first trial hadkilled thirtyone eurasian prisoners in one burst at twenfree ebooks at planet ebookcom59tythree he had perished in action pursued by enemy jetplanes while flying over the indian ocean with importantdespatches he had weighted his body with his machine gunand leapt out of the helicopter into deep water despatchesand all—an end said big brother which it was impossibleto contemplate without feelings of envy big brother added afew remarks on the purity and singlemindedness of comrade ogilvys life he was a total abstainer and a nonsmokerhad no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasiumand had taken a vow of celibacy believing marriage and thecare of a family to be incompatible with a twentyfourhouraday devotion to duty he had no subjects of conversationexcept the principles of ingsoc and no aim in life exceptthe defeat of the eurasian enemy and the huntingdown ofspies saboteurs thoughtcriminals and traitors generallywinston debated with himself whether to award comrade ogilvy the order of conspicuous merit in the end hedecided against it because of the unnecessary crossreferencing that it would entailonce again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubiclesomething seemed to tell him with certainty that tillotsonwas busy on the same job as himself there was no way ofknowing whose job would finally be adopted but he felt aprofound conviction that it would be his own comradeogilvy unimagined an hour ago was now a fact it struckhim as curious that you could create dead men but not living ones comrade ogilvy who had never existed in thepresent now existed in the past and when once the act offorgery

there were some comrades whose societywas pleasanter than that of others syme was a philologist aspecialist in newspeak indeed he was one of the enormousteam of experts now engaged in compiling the

possible in the technicalities of newspeak on which hewas authoritative and interesting winston turned his heada little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyesit was a good hanging said syme reminiscently i thinkit spoils it when they tie their feet together i like to see themkicking and above all at the end the tongue sticking rightout and blue—a quite bright blue thats the detail

was served out to them in handleless china mugsthey threaded their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays on to the metaltopped table on onecorner of which someone had left a pool of stew a filthyliquid mess that had the appearance of vomit winstontook up his mug of gin paused for an instant to collect hisnerve and gulped the oilytasting stuff down when hehad winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that he was hungry he began swallowing spoonfuls ofthe stew which in among its general sloppiness had cubesof spongy pinkish stuff which was probably a preparationof meat neither of them spoke again till they had emptied641984their pannikins from the table at winstons left a littlebehind his back someone was talking rapidly and continuously a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duckwhich pierced the general uproar of the roomhow is the dictionary getting on said winston raisinghis voice to overcome the noiseslowly said syme im on the adjectives its fascinatinghe had brightened up immediately at the mention ofnewspeak he pushed his pannikin aside took up his hunkof bread in one delicate hand and his cheese in the otherand leaned across the table so as to be able to speak withoutshoutingthe eleventh edition is the definitive edition he saidwere getting the language into its final shape—the shapeits going to have when nobody speaks anything

hundreds of them every day werecutting the language down to the bone the eleventh edition wont contain a single word that will become obsoletebefore the year 2050he bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a coupleof mouthfuls then continued speaking with a sort of pedants passion his thin dark face had become animated hiseyes had lost their mocking expression and grown almostdreamyits a beautiful thing the destruction of words of coursefree ebooks at planet ebookcom65the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives but thereare hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well it isntonly the synonyms there are also the antonyms after allwhat justification is there for a word which is simply theopposite of some other word a word contains its oppositein itself take good for instance if you have a word likegood what need is there for a word like bad ungoodwill do just as well—better because its an exact oppositewhich the other is not or again if you want a stronger version of good what sense is there in having a whole stringof vague useless words like excellent and splendid and allthe rest of them plusgood covers the meaning or doubleplusgood if you want something stronger still of coursewe use those forms already but in the final version of newspeak therell be nothing else in the end the whole notionof goodness and badness will be covered by only six words—in reality only one word dont you see the beauty of thatwinston it was bbs idea originally of course he addedas an afterthoughta sort of vapid eagerness flitted across winstons face atthe mention of big brother nevertheless syme immediatelydetected a certain lack of enthusiasmyou havent a real appreciation of newspeak winstonhe said almost sadly even when you write it youre stillthinking in oldspeak ive read some of those pieces thatyou write in the times occasionally theyre good enoughbut theyre translations in your heart youd prefer to stickto oldspeak with all its vagueness and its useless shades ofmeaning you dont grasp the beauty of the destruction of661984words do you know that newspeak is the only language inthe world whose vocabulary gets smaller every yearwinston did know that of course he smiled sympathetically he hoped not trusting himself to speak syme bitoff another fragment of the darkcoloured bread chewed itbriefly and went ondont you see that the whole aim of newspeak is tonarrow the range of thought in the end we shall makethoughtcrime literally impossible because there will be nowords in which to express it every concept that can everbe needed will be expressed by exactly one word with itsmeaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meaningsrubbed out and forgotten already in the eleventh editionwere not far from that point but the process will still becontinuing long after you and i are dead every year fewerand fewer words and the range of consciousness always alittle smaller even now of course theres no reason or excuse for committing thoughtcrime its merely a questionof selfdiscipline realitycontrol but in the end there wontbe any need even for that the revolution will be complete when the language is perfect newspeak is ingsoc andingsoc is newspeak he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction has it ever occurred to you winston that by theyear 2050 at the very latest not a single human being willbe alive who could understand such a conversation as weare having nowexcept—— began winston doubtfully and he stoppedit had been on the tip of his tongue to say except theproles but he checked himself not feeling fully certain thatfree ebooks at planet ebookcom67this remark was not in some way unorthodox syme however had divined what he was about to saythe proles are not human beings he said carelessly by2050—earlier probably—all real knowledge of oldspeakwill have disappeared the whole literature of the past willhave been destroyed chaucer shakespeare milton byron—theyll exist only in newspeak versions not merelychanged into something different but actually changedinto something contradictory of what they used to be eventhe literature of the party will change even the slogans willchange how could you have a slogan like freedom is slavery when the concept of freedom has been abolished thewhole climate of thought will be different in fact there willbe no thought as we understand it now orthodoxy meansnot thinking—not needing to think orthodoxy is unconsciousnessone of these days thought winston with sudden deepconviction syme will be vaporized he is too intelligent hesees too clearly and speaks too plainly the party does notlike such people one day he will disappear it is written inhis facewinston had finished his bread and cheese he turneda little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee atthe table on his left the man with the strident voice wasstill talking remorselessly away a young woman who wasperhaps his secretary and who was sitting with her backto winston was listening to him and seemed to be eagerlyagreeing with everything that he said from time to timewinston caught some such remark as i think youre so right681984i do so agree with you uttered in a youthful and rather sillyfeminine voice but the other voice never stopped for an instant even when the girl was speaking winston knew theman by sight though he knew no more about him than thathe held some important post in the fiction department hewas a man of about thirty with a muscular throat and alarge mobile mouth his head was thrown back a little andbecause of the angle at which he was sitting his spectaclescaught the light and presented to winston two blank discsinstead of eyes what was slightly horrible was that fromthe stream of sound that poured out of his mouth it wasalmost impossible to distinguish a single word just oncewinston caught a phrase—complete and final eliminationof goldsteinism—jerked out very rapidly and as it seemedall in one piece like a line of type cast solid for the rest itwas just a noise a quackquackquacking and yet thoughyou could not actually hear what the man was saying youcould not be in any doubt about its general nature he mightbe denouncing goldstein and demanding sterner measuresagainst thoughtcriminals and saboteurs he might be fulminating against the atrocities of the eurasian army hemight be praising big brother or the heroes on the malabarfront—it made no difference whatever it was you couldbe certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy pureingsoc as he watched the eyeless face with the jaw movingrapidly up and down winston had a curious feeling thatthis was not a real human being but some kind of dummy itwas not the mans brain that was speaking it was his larynxthe stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words butfree ebooks at planet ebookcom69it was not speech in the true sense it was a noise uttered inunconsciousness like the quacking of a ducksyme had fallen silent for a moment and with the handle of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle of stewthe voice from the other table quacked rapidly on easilyaudible in spite of the surrounding dinthere is a word in newspeak said syme i dont knowwhether you know it duckspeak to quack like a duck itis one of those interesting words that have two contradictory meanings applied to an opponent it is abuse appliedto someone you agree with it is praiseunquestionably syme will be vaporized winstonthought again he thought it with a kind of sadness although well knowing that syme despised him and slightlydisliked him and was fully capable of denouncing him asa thoughtcriminal if he saw any reason for doing so therewas something subtly wrong with syme there was something that he lacked discretion aloofness a sort of savingstupidity you could not say that he was unorthodox he believed in the principles of ingsoc he venerated big brotherhe rejoiced over victories he hated heretics not merely withsincerity but with a sort of restless zeal an uptodatenessof information which the ordinary party member did notapproach yet a faint air of disreputability always clung tohim he said things that would have been better unsaid hehad read too many books he frequented the chestnut treecafe haunt of painters and musicians there was no lawnot even an unwritten law against frequenting the chestnut tree cafe yet the place was somehow illomened the701984old discredited leaders of the party had been used to gatherthere before they were finally purged goldstein himself itwas said had sometimes been seen there years and decadesago symes fate was not difficult to foresee and yet it wasa fact that if syme grasped even for three seconds the nature of his winstons secret opinions he would betray himinstantly to the thought police so would anybody else forthat matter but syme more than most zeal was not enoughorthodoxy was unconsciousnesssyme looked up here comes parsons he saidsomething in the tone of his voice seemed to add thatbloody fool parsons winstons fellowtenant at victorymansions was in fact threading his way across the room—a tubby middlesized man with fair hair and a froglike faceat thirtyfive he was already putting on rolls of fat at neckand waistline but his movements were brisk and boyishhis whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large somuch so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls it was almost impossible not to think of him as beingdressed in the blue shorts grey shirt and red neckerchiefof the spies in visualizing him one saw always a pictureof dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms parsons did indeed invariably revert to shorts whena community hike or any other physical activity gave himan excuse for doing so he greeted them both with a cheeryhullo hullo and sat down at the table giving off an intense smell of sweat beads of moisture stood out all overhis pink face his powers of sweating were extraordinaryat the community centre you could always tell when hefree ebooks at planet ebookcom71had been playing tabletennis by the dampness of the bathandle syme had produced a strip of paper on which therewas a long column of words and was studying it with aninkpencil between his fingerslook at him working away in the lunch hour said parsons nudging winston keenness eh whats that youvegot there old boy something a bit too brainy for me i expect smith old boy ill tell you why im chasing you itsthat sub you forgot to give mewhich sub is that said winston automatically feeling for money about a quarter of ones salary had to beearmarked for voluntary subscriptions which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of themfor hate week you know—the housebyhouse fundim treasurer for our block were making an allout effort—going to put on a tremendous show i tell you it wont be myfault if old victory mansions doesnt have the biggest outfitof flags in the whole street two dollars you promised mewinston found and handed over two creased and filthynotes which parsons entered in a small notebook in theneat handwriting of the illiterateby the way old boy he said i hear that little beggar ofmine let fly at you with his catapult yesterday i gave hima good dressingdown for it in fact i told him id take thecatapult away if he does it againi think he was a little upset at not going to the executionsaid winstonah well—what i mean to say shows the right spiritdoesnt it mischievous little beggars they are both of them721984but talk about keenness all they think about is the spiesand the war of course dyou know what that little girl ofmine did last saturday when her troop was on a hike outberkhamsted way she got two other girls to go with herslipped off from the hike and spent the whole afternoonfollowing a strange man they kept on his tail for two hoursright through the woods and then when they got into amersham handed him over to the patrolswhat did they do that for said winston somewhat taken aback parsons went on triumphantlymy kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent—might have been dropped by parachute for instance butheres the point old boy what do you think put her on tohim in the first place she spotted he was wearing a funnykind of shoes—said shed never seen anyone wearing shoeslike that before so the chances were he was a foreignerpretty smart for a nipper of seven ehwhat happened to the man said winstonah that i couldnt say of course but i wouldnt be altogether surprised if—— parsons made the motion of aiminga rifle and clicked his tongue for the explosiongood said syme abstractedly without looking up fromhis strip of paperof course we cant afford to take chances agreed winston dutifullywhat i mean to say there is a war on said parsonsas though in confirmation of this a trumpet call floated from the telescreen just above their heads however itwas not the proclamation of a military victory this time butfree ebooks at planet

completed of the outputof all classes of consumption goods show that the standardof living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the pastyear all over oceania this morning there were irrepressiblespontaneous demonstrations when workers marched out offactories and offices and paraded through the streets withbanners voicing their gratitude to big brother for the newhappy life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon ushere are some of the completed figures foodstuffs——the phrase our new happy life recurred several times ithad been a favourite of late with the ministry of plenty parsons his attention caught by the trumpet call sat listeningwith a sort of gaping solemnity a sort of edified boredomhe could not follow the figures but he was aware that theywere in some way a cause for satisfaction he had lugged outa huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charredtobacco with the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week itwas seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top winston wassmoking a victory cigarette which he held carefully horizontal the new ration did not start till tomorrow and hehad only four cigarettes left for the moment he had shut hisears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff thatstreamed out of the telescreen it appeared that there hadeven been demonstrations to thank big brother for raisingthe chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week and onlyyesterday he reflected it had been announced that the ra741984tion was to be reduced to twenty grammes a week was itpossible that they could swallow that after only twentyfourhours yes they swallowed it parsons swallowed it easilywith the stupidity of an animal the eyeless creature at theother table swallowed it fanatically passionately with a furious desire to track down denounce and vaporize anyonewho should suggest that last week the ration had been thirtygrammes syme too—in some more complex way involving doublethink syme swallowed it was he then alonein the possession of a memorythe fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen as compared with last year there was more foodmore clothes more houses more furniture more cookingpots more fuel more ships more helicopters morebooks more babies—more of everything except diseasecrime and insanity year by year and minute by minuteeverybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwardsas syme had done earlier winston had taken up his spoonand was dabbling in the palecoloured gravy that dribbledacross the table drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern he meditated resentfully on the physical texture oflife had it always been like this had food always tastedlike this he looked round the canteen a lowceilingedcrowded room its walls grimy from the contact of innumerable bodies

the majority of people inairstrip one were small dark and illfavoured it was curious how that beetlelike type proliferated in the ministrieslittle dumpy men growing stout very early in life withshort

was that made for survival it wasnot easy to sayat this moment he was dragged out of his reverie witha violent jerk the girl at the next table had turned partlyround and was looking at him it was the girl with dark hairshe was looking at him in a sidelong way but with curiousintensity the instant she caught his eye she looked awayagainthe sweat started out on winstons backbone a horrible pang of terror went through him it was gone almost atonce but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind whywas she watching him why did she keep following himabout unfortunately he could not remember whether shehad already been at the table when he arrived or had comethere afterwards but yesterday at any rate during the twominutes hate she had sat immediately behind him whenthere was no apparent need to do so quite likely her realobject had been to listen to him and make sure whether hewas shouting loudly enoughhis earlier thought returned to him probably she wasnot actually a member of the

i——for the moment it was too difficult to go on he shut hiseyes and pressed his fingers against them trying to squeezeout the vision that kept recurring he had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at thetop of his voice or to bang his head against the wall to kickover the table and hurl the inkpot through the window—todo any violent or noisy or painful thing that might blackout the memory that was tormenting himyour worst enemy he reflected was your own nervoussystem at any moment the tension inside you was liable totranslate itself into some visible symptom he thought ofa man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks backa quite ordinarylooking man a party member aged thirfree ebooks at planet ebookcom81tyfive to forty tallish and thin carrying a briefcase theywere a few metres apart when the left side of the mans facewas suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm it happenedagain just as they were passing one another it was only atwitch a quiver rapid as the clicking of a camera shutterbut obviously habitual he remembered thinking at thetime that poor devil is done for and what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly unconscious themost deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep therewas no way of guarding against that so far as he could seehe drew his breath and went on writingi went with her through the doorway and across a backyardinto a basement kitchen there was a bed against the walland a lamp on the table turned down very low she——his teeth were set on edge he would have liked to spitsimultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchenhe thought of katharine his wife winston was married—had been married at any rate probably he still was marriedso far as he knew his wife was not dead he seemed tobreathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes andvillainous cheap scent but nevertheless alluring becauseno woman of the party ever used scent or could be imagined as doing so only the proles used scent in his mind thesmell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornicationwhen he had gone with that woman it had been

but it was not a lifeanddeath matter to becaught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forcedlabour camp not more if you had committed no otheroffence and it was easy enough provided that you couldavoid being caught in the act the poorer quarters swarmedwith women who were ready to sell themselves some couldeven be purchased for a bottle of gin which the proles werenot supposed to drink tacitly the party was even inclinedto encourage prostitution as an outlet for instincts whichcould not be altogether suppressed mere debauchery didnot matter very much so long as it was furtive and joylessand only involved the women of a submerged and despisedclass the unforgivable crime was promiscuity betweenparty members but—though this was one of the crimesthat the accused in the great purges invariably confessedto—it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happeningthe aim of the party was not merely to prevent men andwomen from forming loyalties which it might not be ableto control its real undeclared purpose was to remove allpleasure from the sexual act not love so much as eroticism was the enemy inside marriage as well as outside itall marriages between party members had to be approvedby a committee appointed for the purpose and—thoughthe principle was never clearly stated—permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impressionof being physically attracted to one another the only recfree ebooks at planet ebookcom83ognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for theservice of the party sexual intercourse was to be looked onas a slightly disgusting minor operation like having an enema this again was never put into plain words but in anindirect way it was rubbed into every party member fromchildhood onwards there were even organizations suchas the junior antisex league which advocated completecelibacy for both sexes all children were to be begottenby artificial insemination artsem it was called in newspeak and brought up in public institutions this winstonwas aware was not meant altogether seriously but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the party theparty was trying to kill the sex instinct or if it could not bekilled then to distort it and dirty it he did not know whythis was so but it seemed natural that it should be so andas far as the women were concerned the partys efforts werelargely successfulhe thought again of katharine it must be nine ten—nearly eleven years since they had parted it was curioushow seldom he thought of her for days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married they hadonly been together for about fifteen months the party didnot permit divorce but it rather encouraged separation incases where there were no childrenkatharine was a tall fairhaired girl very straight withsplendid movements she had a bold aquiline face a facethat one might have called noble until one discovered thatthere was as nearly as possible nothing behind it very earlyin her married life he had decided—though perhaps it was841984only that he knew her more intimately than he knew mostpeople—that she had without exception the most stupidvulgar empty mind that he had ever encountered she hadnot a thought in her head that was not a slogan and therewas no imbecility absolutely none that she was not capableof swallowing if the party handed it out to her the human soundtrack he nicknamed her in his own mind yethe could have endured living with her if it had not been forjust one thing—sexas soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen to embrace her was like embracing a jointed woodenimage and what was strange was that even when she wasclasping him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength therigidlty of her muscles managed to convey that impression she would lie there with shut eyes neither resistingnor cooperating but submitting it was extraordinarily embarrassing and after a while horrible but even thenhe could have borne living with her if it had been agreedthat they should remain celibate but curiously enough itwas katharine who refused this they must she said produce a child if they could so the performance continued tohappen once a week quite regulariy whenever it was notimpossible she even used to remind him of it in the morning as something which had to be done that evening andwhich must not be forgotten she had two names for it onewas making a baby and the other was our duty to the party yes she had actually used that phrase quite soon hegrew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointedfree ebooks at planet ebookcom85day came round but luckily no child appeared and in theend she agreed to give up trying and soon afterwards theypartedwinston sighed inaudibly he picked up his pen againand wroteshe threw herself down on the bed and at once without anykind of preliminary in the most coarse horrible way you canimagine pulled up her skirt i——he saw himself standing there in the dim lamplightwith the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils andin his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which evenat that moment was mixed up with the thought of katharines white body frozen for ever by the hypnotic powerof the party why did it always have to be like this whycould he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthyscuffles at intervals of years but a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event the women of the party were allalike chastity was as deep ingrained in them as party loyalty by careful early conditioning by games and cold waterby the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and inthe spies and the youth league by lectures parades songsslogans and martial music the natural feeling had beendriven out of them his reason told him that there must beexceptions but his heart did not believe it they were all impregnable as the party intended that they should be andwhat he wanted more even than to be loved was to breakdown that wall of virtue even if it were only once in his861984whole life the sexual act successfully performed was rebellion desire was thoughtcrime even to have awakenedkatharine if he

in his belly died down and the world began tolook more cheerful he took a cigarette from a crumpledpacket marked victory cigarettes and incautiouslyheld it upright whereupon the tobacco fell out on to thefloor with the next he was more successful he went backto the livingroom and sat down at a small table that stoodto the left of the telescreen from the table drawer he tookout a penholder a bottle of ink and a thick quartosizedblank book with a red back and a marbled coverfor some reason the telescreen in the livingroom was inan unusual position instead of being placed as was normalin the end wall where it could command the whole roomit was in the longer wall opposite the window to one sideof it there was a shallow alcove in which winston was nowsitting and which when the flats were built had probablybeen intended to hold bookshelves by sitting in the alcoveand keeping well back winston was able to remain outsidethe range of the telescreen so far as sight went he couldbe heard of course but so long as he stayed in his presentposition he could not be seen it was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thingthat he was now about to dobut it had also been suggested by the book that he had\u00181984just taken out of the drawer it was a peculiarly beautifulbook its smooth creamy paper a little yellowed by age wasof a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past he could guess however that the book wasmuch older than that he had seen it lying in the window ofa frowsy little junkshop in a slummy quarter of the townjust what quarter he did not now remember and had beenstricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possessit party members were supposed not to go into ordinaryshops dealing on the free market it was called but therule was not strictly kept because there were various thingssuch as shoelaces and razor blades which it was impossibleto get hold of in any other way he had given a quick glanceup and down the street and then had slipped inside andbought the book for two dollars fifty at the time he was notconscious of wanting it for any particular purpose he hadcarried it guiltily home in his briefcase even with nothingwritten in it it was a compromising possessionthe thing that he was about to do was to open a diarythis was not illegal nothing was illegal since there were nolonger any laws but if detected it was reasonably certainthat it would be punished by death or at least by twentyfive years in a forcedlabour camp winston fitted a nib intothe penholder and sucked it to get the grease off the penwas an archaic instrument seldom used even for signaturesand he had procured one furtively and with some difficultysimply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy

was usual to dictate everything into the speakwrite which was ofcourse impossible for his present purpose he dipped thepen into the ink and then faltered for just a second a tremor had gone through his bowels to mark the paper was thedecisive act in small clumsy letters he wroteapril 4th 1984he sat back a sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him to begin with he did not know with anycertainty that this was 1984 it must be round about thatdate since he was fairly sure that his age was thirtynineand he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945 butit was never possible nowadays to pin down any date withina year or twofor whom it suddenly occurred to him to wonder was hewriting this diary for the future for the unborn his mindhovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the pageand then fetched up with a bump against the newspeakword doublethink for the first time the magnitude ofwhat he had undertaken came home to him how could youcommunicate with the future it was of its nature impossible either the future would resemble the present in whichcase it would not listen to him or it would be different fromit and his predicament would be meaninglessfor some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper thetelescreen had changed over to strident military music itwas curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the pow101984er of expressing himself but even to have forgotten what itwas that he had originally intended to say for weeks pasthe had been making ready for this moment and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed exceptcourage the actual writing would be easy all he had todo was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head literally foryears at this moment however even the monologue haddried up moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itchingunbearably he dared not scratch it because if he did so italways became inflamed the seconds were ticking by hewas conscious of

did not know what had made him pourout this stream of rubbish but the curious thing was thatwhile he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind to the point where he almost feltequal to writing it down it was he now realized becauseof this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come121984home and begin the diary todayit had happened that morning at the ministry if anything so nebulous could be said to happenit was nearly eleven hundred and in the records department where winston worked they were dragging thechairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen in preparation forthe two minutes hate winston was just taking his placein one of the middle rows when two people whom he knewby sight but had never spoken to came unexpectedly intothe room one of them was a girl whom he often passed inthe corridors he did not know her name but he knew thatshe worked in the fiction department presumably—sincehe had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying aspanner—she had some mechanical job on one of the novelwriting machines she was a boldlooking girl of abouttwentyseven with thick hair a freckled face and swiftathletic movements a narrow scarlet sash emblem of thejunior antisex league was wound several times roundthe waist of her overalls just tightly enough to bring out theshapeliness of her hips winston had disliked her from thevery first moment of seeing her he knew the reason it wasbecause of the atmosphere of hockeyfields and cold bathsand community hikes and general cleanmindedness whichshe managed to carry about with her he disliked nearly allwomen and especially the young and pretty ones it was always the women and above all the young ones who werethe most bigoted adherents of the party the swallowersof slogans the amateur spies and nosersout of unorthofree ebooks at planet ebookcom13doxy but this particular girl gave him the impression ofbeing more dangerous than most once when they passedin the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance whichseemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filledhim with black terror the idea had even crossed his mindthat she might be an agent of the thought police that itwas true was very unlikely still he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness which had fear mixed up in it as well ashostility whenever she was anywhere near himthe other person was a man named obrien a memberof the inner party and holder of some post so importantand remote that winston had only a dim idea of its naturea momentary hush passed over the group of people roundthe chairs as they saw the black overalls of an inner partymember approaching obrien was a large burly man witha thick neck and a coarse humorous brutal face in spite ofhis formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner he had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nosewhich was curiously disarming—in some indefinable waycuriously civilized it was a gesture which if anyone hadstill thought in such terms might have recalled an eighteenthcentury nobleman offering his snuffbox winstonhad seen obrien perhaps a dozen times in almost as manyyears he felt deeply drawn to him and not solely becausehe was intrigued by the contrast between obriens urbanemanner and his prizefighters physique much more it wasbecause of a secretly held belief—or perhaps not even a belief merely a hope—that obriens political orthodoxy wasnot perfect something in his face suggested it irresistibly141984and again perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that waswritten in his face but simply intelligence but at any ratehe had the appearance of being a person that you couldtalk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and gethim alone winston had never made the smallest effort toverify this guess indeed there was no way of doing so atthis moment obrien glanced at his wristwatch saw that itwas nearly eleven hundred and evidently decided to stay inthe records department until the two minutes hate wasover he took a chair in the same row as winston a coupleof places away a small sandyhaired woman who workedin the next cubicle to winston was between them the girlwith dark hair was sitting immediately behindthe next moment a hideous grinding speech as of somemonstrous machine running without oil burst from thebig telescreen at the end of the room it was a noise that setones teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of onesneck the hate had startedas usual the face of emmanuel goldstein the enemy ofthe people had flashed on to the screen there were hisseshere and there among the audience the little sandyhairedwoman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once long agohow long ago nobody quite remembered had been one ofthe leading figures of the party almost on a level with bigbrother himself and then had engaged in counterrevolutionary activities had been condemned to death and hadmysteriously escaped and disappeared the programmes ofthe two minutes hate varied from day to day but there wasfree ebooks at planet ebookcom15none in which goldstein was not

outof his teaching somewhere or other he was still alive andhatching his conspiracies perhaps somewhere beyond thesea under the protection of his foreign paymasters perhapseven—so it was occasionally rumoured—in some hidingplace in oceania itselfwinstons diaphragm was constricted he could neversee the face of goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions it was a lean jewish face with a great fuzzy aureole ofwhite hair and a small goatee beard—a clever face and yetsomehow inherently despicable with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose near the end of which a pairof spectacles was perched it resembled the face of a sheepand the voice too had a sheeplike quality goldstein wasdelivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrinesof the party—an attack so exaggerated and perverse that achild should have been able to see through it and yet justplausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling thatother people less levelheaded than oneself might be takenin by it he was abusing big brother he was denouncingthe dictatorship of the party he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with eurasia he was advocatingfreedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of thought he was crying hysterically thatthe revolution had been betrayed—and all this in rapidpolysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the ha161984bitual style of the orators of the party and even containednewspeak words more newspeak words indeed than anyparty member would normally use in real life and all thewhile lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality whichgoldsteins specious claptrap covered behind his head onthe telescreen there marched the endless columns of theeurasian army—row after row of solidlooking men withexpressionless asiatic faces who swam up to the surfaceof the screen and vanished to be replaced by others exactly similar the dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers bootsformed the background to goldsteins bleating voicebefore the hate had proceeded for thirty seconds uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from halfthe people in the room the selfsatisfied sheeplike face onthe screen and the terrifying power of the eurasian armybehind it were too much to be borne besides the sight oreven the thought of goldstein produced fear and anger automatically he was an object of hatred more constant thaneither eurasia or eastasia since when oceania was at warwith one of these powers it was generally at peace with theother but what was strange was that although goldsteinwas hated and despised by everybody although every dayand a thousand times a day on platforms on the telescreenin newspapers in books his theories were refuted smashedridiculed held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they

there it was a book without a titlepeople referred to it if at all simply as the book but oneknew of such things only through vague rumours neitherthe brotherhood nor the book was a subject that any ordinary party member would mention if there was a way ofavoiding itin its second minute the hate rose to a frenzy peoplewere leaping up and down in their places and shoutingat the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen thelittle sandyhaired woman had turned bright pink andher mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landedfish even obriens heavy face was flushed he was sittingvery straight in his chair his powerful chest swelling andquivering as though he were standing up to the assault of awave the darkhaired girl behind winston had begun crying out swine swine swine and suddenly she picked upa heavy newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen itstruck goldsteins nose and bounced off the voice continued inexorably in a lucid moment winston found that hewas shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair the horrible thing aboutthe two minutes hate was not that one was obliged to act181984a part but on the contrary that it was impossible to avoidjoining in within thirty seconds any pretence was alwaysunnecessary a hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictivenessa desire to kill to torture to smash faces in with a sledgehammer seemed to flow through the whole group of peoplelike an electric current turning one even against ones willinto a grimacing screaming lunatic and yet the rage thatone felt was an abstract undirected emotion which couldbe switched from one object to another like the flame of ablowlamp thus at one moment winstons hatred was notturned against goldstein at all but on the contrary againstbig brother the party and the thought police and at suchmoments his heart went out to the lonely derided hereticon the screen sole guardian of truth and sanity in a worldof lies and yet the very next instant he was at one with thepeople about him and all that was said of goldstein seemedto him to be true at those moments his secret loathing ofbig brother changed into adoration and big brother seemedto tower up an invincible fearless protector standing likea rock against the hordes of asia and goldstein in spiteof his isolation his helplessness and the doubt that hungabout his very existence seemed like some sinister enchanter capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking thestructure of civilizationit was even possible at moments to switch ones hatred this way or that by a voluntary act suddenly by thesort of violent effort with which one wrenches ones headaway from the pillow in a nightmare winston succeededin transferring his hatred from the face on the screen tofree ebooks at planet ebookcom19the darkhaired girl behind him vivid beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind he would flog her to deathwith a rubber truncheon he would tie her naked to a stakeand shoot her full of arrows like saint sebastian he wouldravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax better than before moreover he realized why it was that hehated her he hated her because she was young and prettyand sexless because he wanted to go to bed with her andwould never do so because round her sweet supple waistwhich seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm therewas only the odious scarlet sash aggressive symbol of chastitythe hate rose to its climax the voice of goldstein hadbecome an actual sheeps bleat and for an instant the facechanged into that of a sheep then the sheepface melted intothe figure of a eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancinghuge and terrible his submachine gun roaring and seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen so that someof the people in the front row actually flinched backwardsin their seats but in the same moment drawing a deep sighof relief from everybody the hostile figure melted into theface of big brother blackhaired blackmoustachiod fullof power and mysterious calm and so vast that it almostfilled up the screen nobody heard what big brother wassaying it was merely a few words of encouragement thesort of words that are uttered in the din of battle not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the factof being spoken then the face of big brother faded awayagain and instead the three slogans of the party stood out201984in bold capitalswar is peacefreedom is slaveryignorance is strengthbut the face of big brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen as though the impact that it hadmade on everyones eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately the little sandyhaired woman had flung herselfforward over the back of the chair in front of her with atremulous murmur that sounded like my saviour she extended her arms towards the screen then she buried herface in her hands it was apparent that she was uttering aprayerat this moment the entire group of people broke into adeep slow rhythmical chant of bbbb—over and overagain very slowly with a long pause between the first band the second—a heavy murmurous sound somehowcuriously savage in the background of which one seemedto hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tomtoms for perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept itup it was a refrain that was often heard in moments ofoverwhelming emotion partly it was a sort of hymn to thewisdom and majesty of big brother but still more it wasan act of selfhypnosis a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise winstons entrails seemedto grow cold in the two minutes hate he could not helpsharing in the general delirium but this subhuman chantfree ebooks at planet ebookcom21ing of bbbb always filled him with horror of coursehe chanted with the rest it was impossible to do otherwiseto dissemble your feelings to control your face to do whateveryone else was doing was an instinctive reaction butthere was a space of a couple of seconds during which theexpression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed himand it was exactly at this moment that the significant thinghappened—if indeed it did happenmomentarily he caught obriens eye obrien had stoodup he had taken off his spectacles and was in the act ofresettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesturebut there was a fraction of a second when their eyes metand for as long as it took to happen winston knew—yes heknew—that obrien was thinking the same thing as himself an unmistakable message had passed it was as thoughtheir two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowingfrom one into the other through their eyes i am with youobrien seemed to be saying to him i know precisely whatyou are feeling i know all about your contempt your hatred your disgust but dont worry i am on your side andthen the flash of intelligence was gone and obriens facewas as inscrutable as everybody elsesthat was all and he was already uncertain whether it hadhappened such incidents never had any sequel all that theydid was to keep alive in him the belief or hope that others besides himself were the enemies of the party perhapsthe rumours of vast underground conspiracies were trueafter all—perhaps the brotherhood really existed it wasimpossible in spite of the endless arrests and confessions221984and executions to be sure that the brotherhood was notsimply a myth some days he believed in it some days notthere was no evidence only fleeting glimpses that mightmean anything or nothing snatches of overheard conversation faint scribbles on lavatory walls—once even whentwo strangers met a small movement of the hand whichhad looked as though it might be a signal of recognition itwas all guesswork very likely he had imagined everythinghe had gone back to his cubicle without looking at obrienagain the idea of following up their momentary contacthardly crossed his mind it would have been inconceivablydangerous even if he had known how to set about doing itfor a second two seconds they had exchanged an equivocal glance and that was the end of the story but even thatwas a memorable event in the locked loneliness in whichone had to livewinston roused himself and sat up straighter he let outa belch the gin was rising from his stomachhis eyes refocused on the page he discovered thatwhile he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing asthough by automatic action and it was no longer the samecramped awkward handwriting as before his pen had slidvoluptuously over the smooth paper printing in large neatcapitals—down with big brother down withbig brother down with big brother downwith big brother down with big brotherover and over again filling half a pagehe could not help feeling a twinge of panic it was absurd since the writing of those particular words was notfree ebooks at planet ebookcom23more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diarybut for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiledpages and abandon the enterprise altogetherhe did not do so however because he knew that it wasuseless whether he wrote down with big brotheror whether he refrained from writing it made no difference whether he went on with the diary or whether he didnot go on with it made no difference the thought policewould get him just the same he had committed—wouldstill have committed even if he had never set pen to paper—the essential crime that contained all others in itselfthoughtcrime they called it thoughtcrime was not a thingthat could be concealed for ever you might dodge successfully for a while even for years but sooner or later theywere bound to get youit was always at night—the arrests invariably happenedat night the sudden jerk out of sleep the rough hand shaking your shoulder the lights glaring in your eyes the ring ofhard faces round the bed in the vast majority of cases therewas no trial no report of the arrest people simply disappeared always during the night your name was removedfrom the registers every record of everything you had everdone was wiped out your onetime existence was deniedand then forgotten you were abolished annihilated vaporized was the usual wordfor a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria he began writing in a hurried untidy scrawltheyll shoot me i dont care theyll shoot me in the back of the241984neck i dont care down with big brother they always shoot youin the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother——he sat back in his chair slightly ashamed of himself andlaid down the pen the next moment he started violentlythere was a knocking at the dooralready he sat as still as a mouse in the futile hope thatwhoever it was might go away after a single attempt but nothe knocking was repeated the worst thing of all would beto delay his heart was thumping like a drum but his facefrom long habit was probably expressionless he got up andmoved heavily towards the doorfree ebooks at planet ebookcom25chapter 2as he put his hand to the doorknob winston saw thathe had left the diary open on the table down withbig brother was written all over it in letters almost bigenough to be legible across the room it was an inconceivably stupid thing to have done but he realized even in hispanic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper byshutting the book while the ink was wethe drew in his breath and opened the door instantlya warm wave of relief flowed through him a colourlesscrushedlooking woman with wispy hair and a lined facewas standing outsideoh comrade she began

unwillingly evicted from the youth league and before graduatinginto the youth league he had managed to stay on in thespies for a year beyond the statutory age at the ministryhe was employed in some

were both leaping round him shoutingtraitor and thoughtcriminal the little girl imitatingfree ebooks at planet ebookcom29her brother in every movement it was somehow slightlyfrightening like the gambolling of tiger cubs which willsoon grow up into maneaters there was a sort of calculating ferocity in the boys eye a quite evident desire to hit orkick winston and a consciousness of being very nearly bigenough to do so it was a good job it was not a real pistol hewas holding winston thoughtmrs parsons eyes flitted nervously from winston to thechildren and back again in the better light of

always clamoured to be taken to see it hetook his leave of mrs parsons and made for the door but hehad not gone six steps down the passage when somethinghit the back of his neck an agonizingly painful blow it wasas though a redhot wire had been jabbed into him he spunround just in time to see mrs parsons dragging her son backinto the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult301984goldstein bellowed the boy as the door closed on himbut what most struck winston was the look of helplessfright on the womans greyish faceback in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreenand sat down at the table again still rubbing his neck themusic from the telescreen had stopped instead a clippedmilitary voice was reading out with a sort of brutal relisha description of the armaments of the new floating fortress which had just been anchored between iceland andthe faroe lslandswith those children he thought that wretched woman must lead a life of terror another year two years andthey would be watching her night and day for symptoms ofunorthodoxy nearly all children nowadays were horriblewhat was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the spies they were systematically turned intoungovernable little savages and yet this produced in themno tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of theparty on the contrary they adored the party and everything connected with it the songs the processions thebanners the hiking the drilling with dummy rifles theyelling of slogans the worship of big brother—it was all asort of glorious game to them all their ferocity was turnedoutwards against the enemies of the state against foreigners traitors saboteurs thoughtcriminals it was almostnormal for people over thirty to be frightened of their ownchildren and with good reason for hardly a week passedin which the times did not carry a paragraph describinghow some eavesdropping little sneak—child hero was thefree ebooks at planet ebookcom31phrase generally used—had overheard some compromisingremark and denounced its parents to the thought policethe sting of the catapult bullet had worn off he pickedup his pen halfheartedly wondering whether he could findsomething more to write in the diary suddenly he beganthinking of obrien againyears ago—how long was it seven years it must be—hehad dreamed that he was walking through a pitchdarkroom and someone sitting to one side of him had said ashe passed we shall meet in the place where there is nodarkness it was said very quietly almost casually—a statement not a command he had walked on without pausingwhat was curious was that at the time in the dream thewords had not made much impression on him it was onlylater and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance he could not now remember whether it was beforeor after having the dream that he had seen obrien for thefirst time nor could he remember when he had first identified the voice as obriens but at any rate the identificationexisted it was obrien who had spoken to him out of thedarkwinston had never been able to feel sure—even after thismornings flash of the eyes it was still impossible to be surewhether obrien was a friend or an enemy nor did it evenseem to matter greatly there was a link of understandingbetween them more important than affection or partisanship we shall meet in the place where there is no darknesshe had said winston did not know what it meant only thatin some way or another it would come true321984the voice from the telescreen paused a trumpet callclear and beautiful floated into the stagnant air the voicecontinued raspinglyattention your attention please a newsflash has thismoment arrived from the malabar front our forces in southindia have won a glorious victory i am authorized to saythat the action we are now reporting may well bring the warwithin measurable distance of its end here is the newsflash——bad news coming thought winston and sure enoughfollowing on a gory description of the annihilation of aeurasian army with stupendous figures of killed and prisoners came the announcement that as from next week thechocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes totwentywinston belched again the gin was wearing off leavinga deflated feeling the telescreen—perhaps to celebrate thevictory perhaps to drown the memory of the lost chocolate—crashed into

same slogans were inscribedand on the other face of the coin the head of big brother even from the coin the eyes pursued you on coins onstamps on the covers of books on banners on posters andon the

loopholes of a fortress his heartquailed before the enormous pyramidal shape it was toostrong it could not be stormed a thousand rocket bombswould not batter it down he wondered again for whom hewas writing the diary for the future for the past—for anage that might be imaginary and in front of him there laynot death but annihilation the diary would be reducedto ashes and himself to vapour only

becameimportant to stay alive as long as possible two fingers of hisright hand were inkstained it was exactly the kind of detailthat might betray you some nosing zealot in the ministrya woman probably someone like the little sandyhairedwoman or the darkhaired girl from the fiction department might start wondering why he had been writingduring the lunch interval why he had used an oldfashioned pen what he had been writing—and then drop ahint in the appropriate quarter he went to the bathroomand carefully scrubbed the ink away with the gritty darkbrown soap which rasped your skin like sandpaper and wastherefore well adapted for this purposehe put the diary away in the drawer it was quite uselessto think of hiding it but he could at least make sure whetheror not its existence had been discovered a hair laid acrossthe pageends was too obvious with the tip of his finger hepicked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and deposited it on the corner of the cover where it was bound to beshaken off if the book was moved361984chapter 3winston was dreaming of his motherhe must he thought have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had disappeared she wasa tall statuesque rather silent woman with slow movements and magnificent fair hair his father he rememberedmore vaguely as dark and thin dressed always in neat darkclothes winston remembered especially the very thin solesof his fathers shoes and wearing spectacles the two ofthem must evidently have been swallowed up in one of thefirst great purges of the fiftiesat this moment his mother was sitting in some placedeep down beneath him with his young sister in her armshe did not remember his sister at all except as a tiny feeblebaby always silent with large watchful eyes both of themwere looking up at him they were down in some subterranean place—the bottom of a well for instance or a verydeep grave—but it was a place which already far below himwas itself moving downwards they were in the saloon ofa sinking ship looking up at him through the darkeningwater there was still air in the saloon they could still seehim and he them but all the while they were sinking downdown into the green waters which in another moment musthide them from sight for ever he was out in the light andair while they were being sucked down to death and theyfree ebooks at planet ebookcom37were down there because he was up here he knew it andthey knew it and he could see the knowledge in their facesthere was no reproach either in their faces or in their heartsonly the knowledge that they must die in order that hemight remain alive and that this was part of the unavoidable order of thingshe could not remember what had happened but he knewin his dream that in some way the lives of his mother andhis sister had been sacrificed to his own it was one of thosedreams which while retaining the characteristic dreamscenery are a continuation of ones intellectual life andin which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which stillseem new and valuable after one is awake the thing thatnow suddenly struck winston was that his mothers deathnearly thirty years ago had been tragic and sorrowful in away that was no longer possible tragedy he perceived belonged to the ancient time to a time when there was stillprivacy love and friendship and when the members of afamily stood by one another without needing to know thereason his mothers memory tore at his heart because shehad died loving him when he was too young and selfishto love her in return and because somehow he did not remember how she had sacrificed herself to a conception ofloyalty that was private and unalterable such things hesaw could not happen today today there were fear hatredand pain but no dignity of emotion no deep or complexsorrows all this he seemed to see in the large eyes of hismother and his sister looking up at him through the greenwater hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking381984suddenly he was standing on short springy turf on asummer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gildedthe ground the landscape that he was looking at recurredso often in his dreams that he was never fully certainwhether or not he had seen it in the real world in his waking thoughts he called it the golden country it was an oldrabbitbitten pasture with a foottrack wandering across itand a molehill here and there in the ragged hedge on theopposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees wereswaying very faintly in the breeze their leaves just stirringin dense masses like womens hair somewhere near at handthough out of sight there was a clear slowmoving streamwhere dace were swimming in the pools under the willowtreesthe girl with dark hair was coming towards them acrossthe field with what seemed a single movement she tore offher clothes and flung them disdainfully aside her bodywas white and smooth but it aroused no desire in him indeed he barely looked at it what overwhelmed him in thatinstant was admiration for the gesture with which she hadthrown her clothes aside with its grace and carelessnessit seemed to annihilate a whole culture a whole systemof thought as though big brother and the party and thethought police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm that too was a gesturebelonging to the ancient time winston woke up with theword shakespeare on his lipsthe telescreen was giving forth an earsplitting whistlewhich continued on the same note for thirty seconds itfree ebooks at planet ebookcom39was nought seven fifteen gettingup time for office workerswinston wrenched his body out of bed—naked for a member of the outer party received only 3000 clothing couponsannually and a suit of pyjamas was 600—and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chairthe physical jerks would begin in three minutes the nextmoment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit whichnearly always attacked him soon after waking up it emptiedhis lungs so completely that he could only begin breathingagain by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gaspshis veins had swelled with the effort of the cough and thevaricose ulcer had started itchingthirty to forty group yapped a piercing female voicethirty to forty group take your places please thirties tofortieswinston sprang to attention in front of the telescreenupon which the image of a youngish woman scrawny butmuscular dressed in tunic and gymshoes had already appearedarms bending and stretching she rapped out takeyour time by me one two three four one two threefour come on comrades put a bit of life into it one twothree four one two three fourthe pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out ofwinstons mind the impression made by his dream and therhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhatas he mechanically shot his arms back and forth wearingon his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during the physical jerks he was struggling401984to think his way backward into the dim period of his earlychildhood it was extraordinarily difficult beyond the latefifties everything faded when there were no external records that you could refer to even the outline of your ownlife lost its sharpness you remembered huge events whichhad quite probably not happened you remembered thedetail of incidents without being able to recapture their atmosphere and there were long blank periods to which youcould assign nothing everything had been different theneven the names of countries and their shapes on the maphad been different airstrip one for instance had not beenso called in those days it had been called england or britain though london he felt fairly certain had always beencalled londonwinston could not definitely remember a time when hiscountry had not been at war but it was evident that therehad been a fairly long interval of peace during his childhood because one of his early memories was of an air raidwhich appeared to take everyone by surprise perhaps it wasthe time when the atomic bomb had fallen on colchesterhe did not remember the raid itself but he did rememberhis fathers hand clutching his own as they hurried downdown down into some place deep in the earth round andround a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and whichfinally so wearied his legs that he began whimpering andthey had to stop and rest his mother in her slow dreamyway was following a long way behind them she was carrying his baby sister—or perhaps it was only a bundle ofblankets that she was carrying he was not certain whetherfree ebooks at planet ebookcom41his sister had been born then finally they had emerged intoa noisy crowded place which he had realized to be a tubestationthere were people sitting all over the stoneflagged floorand other people packed tightly together were sitting onmetal bunks one above the other winston and his motherand father found themselves a place on the floor and nearthem an old man and an old woman were sitting side byside on a bunk the old man had on a decent dark suit anda black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair hisface was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears hereeked of gin it seemed to breathe out of his skin in placeof sweat and one could have fancied that the tears wellingfrom his eyes were pure gin but though slightly drunk hewas also suffering under some grief that was genuine andunbearable in his childish way winston grasped that someterrible thing something that was beyond forgiveness andcould never be remedied had just happened it also seemedto him that he knew what it was someone whom the oldman loved—a little granddaughter perhaps—had beenkilled every few minutes the old man kept repeatingwe didnt ought to ave trusted em i said so ma didnt ithats what comes of trusting em i said so all along wedidnt ought to ave trusted the buggersbut which buggers they didnt ought to have trustedwinston could not now remembersince about that time war had been literally continu421984ous though strictly speaking it had not always been thesame war for several months during his childhood therehad been confused street fighting in london itself some ofwhich he remembered vividly but to trace out the historyof the whole period to say who was fighting whom at anygiven moment would have been utterly impossible sinceno written record and no spoken word ever made mentionof any other alignment than the existing one at this moment for example in 1984 if it was 1984 oceania was atwar with eurasia and in alliance with eastasia in no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the threepowers had at any time been grouped along different linesactually as winston well knew it was only four years sinceoceania had been at war with eastasia and in alliance witheurasia but that was merely a piece of furtive knowledgewhich he happened to possess because his memory was notsatisfactorily under control officially the change of partners had never happened oceania was at war with eurasiatherefore oceania had always been at war with eurasia theenemy of the moment always represented absolute evil andit followed that any past or future agreement with him wasimpossiblethe frightening thing he reflected for the ten thousandth time as he forced his shoulders painfully backwardwith hands on hips they were gyrating their bodies fromthe waist an exercise that was supposed to be good for theback muscles—the frightening thing was that it might allbe true if the party could thrust its hand into the past andsay of this or that event it never happened—thatfree ebooks at planet ebookcom43surely was more terrifying than mere torture and deaththe party said that oceania had never been in alliancewith eurasia he winston smith knew that oceania hadbeen in alliance with eurasia as short a time as four yearsago but where did that knowledge exist only in his ownconsciousness which in any case must soon be annihilatedand if all others accepted the lie which the party imposed—if all records told the same tale—then the lie passed intohistory and became truth who controls the past ran theparty slogan controls the future who controls the presentcontrols the past and yet the past though of its nature alterable never had been altered whatever was true now wastrue from everlasting to

exercise which sent shooting painsall the way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended bybringing on another coughing fit the halfpleasant quality went out of his meditations the past he reflected hadnot merely been altered it had been actually destroyed forhow could you establish even the most obvious fact whenthere existed no record outside your own memory he triedto remember in what year he had first heard mention ofbig brother he thought it must have been at some time inthe sixties but it was impossible to be certain in the partyhistories of course big brother figured as the leader andguardian of the revolution since its very earliest days hisexploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time untilalready they extended into the fabulous world of the fortiesand the thirties when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of london in greatgleaming motorcars or horse carriages with glass sidesthere was no knowing how much of this legend was truefree ebooks at planet ebookcom45and how much invented winston could not even remember at what date the party itself had come into existence hedid not believe he had ever heard the word ingsoc before1960 but it was possible that in its oldspeak form—english socialism that is to say—it had been current earliereverything melted into mist sometimes indeed you couldput your finger on a definite lie it was not true for exampleas was claimed in the party history books that the partyhad invented aeroplanes he remembered aeroplanes sincehis earliest childhood but you could prove

thenearness of the telescreen could prevent him fromuttering when his days work started winston pulled thespeakwrite towards him blew the dust from its mouthpieceand put on his spectacles then he unrolled and clippedtogether four small cylinders of paper which had alreadyflopped out of the pneumatic tube on the righthand sideof his deskin the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices tothe right of the speakwrite a small pneumatic tube for written messages to the left a larger one for newspapers and inthe side wall within easy reach of winstons arm a largeoblong slit protected by a wire grating this last was for thedisposal of waste paper similar slits existed in thousands ortens of thousands throughout the building not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor for somereason they were nicknamed memory holes when oneknew that any document was due for destruction or evenwhen one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about it was anautomatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory holeand drop it in whereupon it would be whirled away on acurrent of warm air to the enormous furnaces which werehidden somewhere in the recesses of the buildingwinston examined the four slips of paper which he had481984unrolled each contained a message of only one or two linesin the abbreviated jargon—not actually newspeak but consisting largely of newspeak words—which was used in theministry for internal purposes they rantimes 17384 bb speech malreported africa rectifytimes 191283 forecasts 3 yp 4th quarter 83 misprints verifycurrent issuetimes 14284

of figureswinston dialled back numbers on the telescreen andcalled for the appropriate issues of the times which slidout of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes delaythe messages he had received referred to articles or newsitems which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter or as the official phrase had it to rectify forexample it appeared from the times of the

ebookcom49launched in north africa as it happened the eurasianhigher command had launched its offensive in south india and left north africa alone it was therefore necessaryto rewrite a paragraph of big brothers speech in such away as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened or again the times of the nineteenth of decemberhad published the official forecasts of the output of variousclasses of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of 1983which was also the sixth quarter of the ninth threeyearplan todays issue contained a statement of the actual output from which it appeared that the forecasts were in everyinstance grossly wrong winstons job was to rectify theoriginal figures by making them agree with the later onesas for the third message it referred to a very simple errorwhich could be set right in a couple of minutes as short atime ago as february the ministry of plenty had issued apromise a categorical pledge were the official words thatthere would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during1984 actually as winston was aware the chocolate rationwas to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the endof the present week all that was needed was to substitutefor the original promise a warning that it would probablybe necessary to reduce the ration at some time in aprilas soon as winston had dealt with each of the messageshe clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriatecopy of the times and pushed them into the pneumatictube then with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious he crumpled up the original message andany notes that he himself had made and dropped them into501984the memory hole to be devoured by the flameswhat happened in the unseen labyrinth to which thepneumatic tubes led he did not know in detail but he didknow in general terms as soon as all the corrections whichhappened to be necessary in any particular number of thetimes had been assembled and collated that number wouldbe reprinted the original copy destroyed and the correctedcopy placed on the files in its stead this process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers butto books periodicals pamphlets posters leaflets filmssoundtracks cartoons photographs—to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably holdany political or ideological significance day by day andalmost minute by minute the past was brought up to datein this way every prediction made by the party could beshown by documentary evidence to have been correct norwas any item of news or any expression of opinion

possible once the deed was doneto prove that any falsification had taken place the largestsection of the records department far larger than the oneon which winston worked consisted simply of personswhose duty it was to track down and collect all copies ofbooks newspapers and other documents which had beensuperseded and were due for destruction a number of thetimes which might because of

other copy existed to contradict itbooks also were recalled and rewritten again and againand were invariably reissued without any admission thatany alteration had been made even the written instructions which winston received and which he invariably gotrid of as soon as he had dealt with them never stated orimplied that an act of forgery was to be committed alwaysthe reference was to slips errors misprints or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests ofaccuracybut actually he thought as he readjusted the ministryof plentys figures it was not even forgery it was merely thesubstitution of one piece of nonsense for another most ofthe material that you were dealing with had no connexionwith anything in the real world not even the kind of connexion that is contained in a direct lie statistics were justas much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version a great deal of the time you were expected tomake them up out of your head for example the ministry of plentys forecast had estimated the output of bootsfor the quarter at 145 million pairs the actual output wasgiven as sixtytwo millions winston however in rewritingthe forecast marked the figure down to fiftyseven millionsso as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had beenoverfulfilled in any case sixtytwo millions was no nearer the truth than fiftyseven millions or than 145 millionsvery likely no boots had been produced at all likelier stillnobody knew how many had been produced much less521984cared all one knew was that every quarter astronomicalnumbers of boots were produced on paper while perhapshalf the population of oceania went barefoot and so it waswith every class of recorded fact great or small everythingfaded away into a shadowworld in which finally even thedate of the year had become uncertainwinston glanced across the hall in the correspondingcubicle on the other side a small preciselooking darkchinned man named tillotson was working steadily awaywith a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth veryclose to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite he had the air oftrying to keep what he was saying a secret between himselfand the telescreen he looked up and his spectacles darteda hostile flash in winstons directionwinston hardly knew tillotson and had no idea whatwork he was employed on people in the records department did not readily talk about their jobs in the longwindowless hall with its double row of cubicles and its endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring intospeakwrites there were quite a dozen people whom winston did not even know by name though he daily saw themhurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in thetwo minutes hate he knew that in the cubicle next to himthe little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out simply at tracking down and deleting from the press the namesof people who had been vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed there was a certain

hairyears and a surprising talent for juggling with rhymes andmetres was engaged in producing garbled versions—definitive texts they were called—of poems which had becomeideologically offensive but which for one reason or anotherwere to be retained in the anthologies and this hall withits fifty workers or thereabouts was only one subsection asingle cell as it were in the huge complexity of the recordsdepartment beyond above below were other swarmsof workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobsthere were the huge printingshops with their subeditorstheir typography experts and their elaborately equippedstudios for the faking of photographs there was the teleprogrammes section with its engineers its producers andits teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices there were the armies of reference clerks whosejob was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicalswhich were due for recall there were the vast repositorieswhere the corrected documents were stored and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were destroyed andsomewhere or other quite anonymous there were the directing brains who coordinated the whole effort and laiddown the lines of policy which made it necessary that thisfragment of the past should be preserved that one falsifiedand the other rubbed out of existenceand the records department after all was itself only asingle branch of the ministry of truth whose primary jobwas not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizensof oceania with newspapers films textbooks telescreen541984programmes plays novels—with every conceivable kind ofinformation instruction or entertainment from a statue toa slogan from a lyric poem to a biological treatise and froma childs spellingbook to a newspeak dictionary and theministry had not only to supply the multifarious needs ofthe party but also to repeat the whole operation at a lowerlevel for the benefit of the proletariat there was a wholechain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature music drama and entertainment generally herewere produced rubbishy newspapers containing almostnothing except sport crime and astrology sensationalfivecent novelettes films oozing with sex and sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanicalmeans on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator there was even a whole subsection—pornosec itwas called in newspeak—engaged in producing the lowestkind of pornography which was sent out in sealed packetsand which no party member other than those who workedon it was permitted to look atthree messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube whilewinston was working but they were simple matters andhe had disposed of them before the two minutes hate interrupted him when the hate was over he returned tohis cubicle took the newspeak dictionary from the shelfpushed the speakwrite to one side cleaned his spectaclesand settled down to his main job of the morningwinstons greatest pleasure in life was in his work mostof it was a tedious routine but included in it there were alsojobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself infree ebooks at planet

supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailorsin the floating fortresses a certain comrade withers aprominent member of the inner party had been singled outfor special mention and awarded a decoration the order ofconspicuous merit second classthree months later ffcc had suddenly been dissolved561984with no reasons given one could assume that withers andhis associates were now in disgrace but there had been noreport of the matter in the press or on the telescreen thatwas to be expected since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced the greatpurges involving thousands of people with public trials oftraitors and thoughtcriminals who made abject confessionof their crimes and were afterwards executed were specialshowpieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple ofyears more commonly people who had incurred the displeasure of the party simply disappeared and were neverheard of again one never had the smallest clue as to whathad happened to them in some cases they might not evenbe dead perhaps thirty people personally known to winston not counting his parents had disappeared at one timeor anotherwinston stroked his nose gently with a paperclip in thecubicle across the way comrade tillotson was still crouching secretively over his speakwrite he raised his head fora moment again the hostile spectacleflash winston wondered whether comrade tillotson was engaged on the samejob as himself it was perfectly possible so tricky a piece ofwork would never be entrusted to a single person on theother hand to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place verylikely as many as a dozen people were now working awayon rival versions of what big brother had actually said andpresently some master brain in the inner party would select this version or that would reedit it and set in motionfree ebooks at planet ebookcom57the complex processes of crossreferencing that would berequired and then the chosen lie would pass into the permanent records and become truthwinston did not know why withers had been disgracedperhaps it was for corruption or incompetence perhaps bigbrother was merely getting rid of a toopopular subordinate perhaps withers or someone close to him had beensuspected of heretical tendencies or perhaps—what waslikeliest of all—the thing had simply happened becausepurges and vaporizations were a necessary part of the mechanics of government the only real clue lay in the wordsrefs unpersons which indicated that withers was alreadydead you could not invariably assume this to be the casewhen people were arrested sometimes they were releasedand allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year ortwo years before being executed very occasionally someperson whom you had believed dead long since would makea ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he wouldimplicate hundreds of others by his testimony before vanishing this time for ever withers however was already anunperson he did not exist he had never existed winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reversethe tendency of big brothers speech it was better to makeit deal with something totally unconnected with its original subjecthe might turn the speech into the usual denunciation oftraitors and thoughtcriminals but that was a little too obvious while to invent a victory at the front or some triumphof overproduction in the ninth threeyear plan might581984complicate the records too much what was needed was apiece of pure fantasy suddenly there sprang into his mindready made as it were the image of a certain comrade ogilvy who had recently died in battle in heroic circumstancesthere were occasions when big brother devoted his orderfor the day to commemorating some humble rankandfileparty member whose life and death he held up as an example worthy to be followed today he should commemoratecomrade ogilvy it was true that there was no such personas comrade ogilvy but a few lines of print and a couple offaked photographs would soon bring him into existencewinston thought for a moment then pulled the speakwrite towards him and began

he had no subjects of conversationexcept the principles of ingsoc and no aim in life exceptthe defeat of the eurasian enemy and the huntingdown ofspies saboteurs thoughtcriminals and traitors

adjectives but thereare hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well it isntonly the synonyms there are also the antonyms after allwhat justification is there for a word which is simply theopposite of some other word a word contains its oppositein itself take good for instance if you have a word likegood what need is there for a word like bad ungoodwill do just as well—better because its an exact oppositewhich the other is not or again if you want a stronger version of good what sense is there in having a whole stringof vague useless words like excellent and splendid and allthe rest of them plusgood covers the meaning or doubleplusgood if you want something stronger still of coursewe use those forms already but in the final version of newspeak therell be nothing else in the end the whole notionof goodness and badness will be covered by only six words—in reality only one word dont you see the beauty of thatwinston it was bbs idea originally of course he addedas an

of the darkcoloured bread chewed itbriefly and went ondont you see that the whole aim of newspeak is tonarrow the range of thought in the end we shall makethoughtcrime literally impossible because there will be nowords in which to express it every concept that can everbe needed will be expressed by exactly one word with itsmeaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meaningsrubbed out and forgotten already in the eleventh editionwere not far from that point but the process will still becontinuing long after you and i are dead every year fewerand fewer words and the range of consciousness always alittle smaller even now of course theres no reason or excuse for committing thoughtcrime its merely a questionof selfdiscipline realitycontrol but in the end there wontbe any need even for that the revolution will be complete when the language is perfect newspeak is ingsoc andingsoc is newspeak he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction has it ever occurred to you winston that by theyear 2050 at the very latest not a single human being willbe alive who could understand such a conversation as weare having nowexcept—— began winston doubtfully and he stoppedit had been on the tip of his tongue to say except theproles but he checked himself not feeling fully certain thatfree ebooks at planet ebookcom67this remark was not in some way unorthodox syme however had divined what he was about to saythe proles are not human beings he said carelessly by2050—earlier probably—all real knowledge of oldspeakwill have disappeared the whole literature of the past willhave been destroyed chaucer shakespeare milton byron—theyll exist only in newspeak versions not merelychanged into something different but actually changedinto something contradictory of what they used to be eventhe literature of the party will change even the slogans willchange how could you have a slogan like freedom is slavery when the concept of freedom has been abolished thewhole climate of thought will be different in fact there willbe no thought as we understand it now orthodoxy meansnot thinking—not needing to think orthodoxy is unconsciousnessone of these days thought winston with sudden deepconviction syme will be vaporized he is too intelligent hesees too clearly and speaks too plainly the party does notlike such people one day he will disappear it is written inhis facewinston had finished his bread and cheese he turneda little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee atthe table on his left the man with the strident voice wasstill talking remorselessly away a young woman who wasperhaps his secretary and who was sitting with her backto winston was listening to him and seemed to be eagerlyagreeing with everything that he said from time to timewinston caught some such remark as i think youre so right681984i do so agree with you uttered in a youthful and rather sillyfeminine voice but the other voice never stopped for an instant even when the girl was speaking winston knew theman by sight though he knew no more about him than thathe held some important post in the fiction department hewas a man of about thirty with a muscular throat and alarge mobile mouth his head was thrown back a little andbecause of the angle at which he was sitting his spectaclescaught the light and presented to winston two blank discsinstead of eyes what was slightly horrible was that fromthe stream of sound that poured out of his mouth it wasalmost impossible to distinguish a single word just oncewinston caught a phrase—complete and final eliminationof goldsteinism—jerked out very rapidly and as it seemedall in one piece like a line of type cast solid for the rest itwas just a noise a quackquackquacking and yet thoughyou could not actually hear what the man was saying youcould not be in any doubt about its general nature he mightbe denouncing goldstein and demanding sterner measuresagainst thoughtcriminals and saboteurs he might be fulminating against the atrocities of the eurasian army hemight be praising big brother or the heroes on the malabarfront—it made no difference whatever it was you couldbe certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy pureingsoc as he watched the eyeless face with the jaw movingrapidly up and down winston had a curious feeling thatthis was not a real human being but some kind of dummy itwas not the mans

sadness although well knowing that syme despised him and slightlydisliked him and was fully capable of denouncing him asa thoughtcriminal if he saw any reason for doing so therewas something subtly wrong with syme there was something that he lacked discretion aloofness a sort of savingstupidity you could not say that he was unorthodox he believed in the principles of ingsoc he venerated big brotherhe rejoiced over victories he hated heretics not merely withsincerity but with a sort of restless zeal an uptodatenessof information which the ordinary party member did notapproach yet a faint air of disreputability always clung tohim he said things that would have been better unsaid hehad read too many books he frequented the chestnut treecafe haunt of painters and musicians there was no

shirt and red neckerchiefof the spies in visualizing him one saw always a pictureof dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms parsons did indeed invariably revert to shorts whena community hike or any other physical activity gave himan excuse for doing so he greeted them both with a cheeryhullo hullo and sat down at the table giving off an intense smell of sweat beads of

then when they got into amersham handed him over to the patrolswhat did they do that for said winston somewhat taken aback parsons went on triumphantlymy kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent—might have been dropped by parachute for instance butheres the point old boy what do you think put her on tohim in the first place she spotted he was wearing a funnykind of shoes—said shed never seen anyone wearing shoeslike that before so the chances were he was a foreignerpretty smart for a nipper of seven ehwhat happened to the man said winstonah that i couldnt say of course but i wouldnt be altogether surprised if—— parsons made the motion of aiminga rifle and clicked his tongue for the explosiongood said syme abstractedly without looking up fromhis strip of paperof course we cant afford to take chances agreed winston dutifullywhat i mean to say there is a war on said parsonsas though in confirmation of this a trumpet call floated from the telescreen just above their heads however itwas not the proclamation of a military victory this time butfree ebooks at planet ebookcom73merely an announcement from the ministry of plentycomrades cried an eager youthful voice attentioncomrades we have glorious news for you we have won thebattle for production returns now completed of the outputof all classes of consumption goods show that the standardof living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the pastyear all over oceania this morning there were irrepressiblespontaneous demonstrations when workers marched out offactories and offices and paraded through the streets withbanners voicing their gratitude to big brother for the newhappy life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon ushere are some of the completed figures foodstuffs——the phrase our new happy life recurred several times ithad been a favourite of late with the ministry of plenty parsons his attention caught by the trumpet call sat listeningwith a sort of gaping solemnity a sort of edified boredomhe could not follow the figures but he was aware that theywere in some way a cause for satisfaction he had lugged outa huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charredtobacco with the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week itwas seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top winston wassmoking a victory cigarette which he held carefully horizontal the new ration did not start till tomorrow and hehad only four cigarettes left for the moment he had shut hisears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff thatstreamed out of the telescreen it appeared that there hadeven been demonstrations to thank big brother for raisingthe chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week and onlyyesterday he reflected it had been announced that the ra741984tion was to be reduced to twenty grammes a week was itpossible that they could swallow that after only twentyfourhours yes they swallowed it parsons swallowed it easilywith the stupidity of an animal the eyeless creature at theother table swallowed it fanatically passionately with a furious desire to track down denounce and vaporize anyonewho should suggest that last week the ration had been thirtygrammes syme too—in some more complex way involving doublethink syme swallowed it was he then alonein the possession of a memorythe fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen as compared with last year there was more foodmore clothes more houses more furniture more cookingpots more fuel more ships more helicopters morebooks more babies—more of everything except diseasecrime and insanity year by year and minute by minuteeverybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwardsas syme had done earlier winston had taken up his spoonand was dabbling in the palecoloured gravy that dribbledacross the table drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern he meditated resentfully on the physical texture oflife had it always been like this had food always tastedlike this he looked round the canteen a

unless one had some kind of ancestralmemory that things had once been differenthe looked round the canteen again nearly everyone wasugly and would still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue overalls on the far side of theroom sitting at a table alone a small curiously beetlelikeman was drinking a cup of coffee his little eyes darting suspicious glances from side to side how easy it was thoughtwinston if you did not look about you to believe that thephysical type set up by the party as an ideal—tall muscular youths and deepbosomed maidens blondhaired vitalsunburnt carefree—existed and even predominated ac761984tually so far as he could judge the majority of people inairstrip one were small dark and illfavoured it was curious how that beetlelike type proliferated in the ministrieslittle dumpy men growing stout very early in life withshort legs swift scuttling movements and fat inscrutablefaces with very small eyes it was the type that seemed toflourish best under the dominion of the partythe announcement from the ministry of plenty endedon another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music parsons stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment offigures took his pipe out of his mouththe ministry of plentys certainly done a good job thisyear he said with a knowing shake of his head by the waysmith old boy i suppose you havent got any razor bladesyou can let me havenot one said winston ive been using the same bladefor six weeks myselfah well—just thought id ask you old boysorry said winstonthe quacking voice from the next table temporarily silenced during the ministrys announcement had started upagain as loud as ever for some reason winston suddenlyfound himself thinking of mrs parsons with her wispy hairand the dust in the creases of her face within two yearsthose children would be denouncing her to the thoughtpolice mrs parsons would be vaporized syme would bevaporized winston would be vaporized obrien wouldbe

nimbly through the labyrinthine corridors ofministries they too would never be vaporized and the girlwith dark hair the girl from the fiction department—shewould never be vaporized either it seemed to him that heknew instinctively who would survive and who would perish though just what it was that made for survival it wasnot easy to sayat this moment he was dragged out of his reverie witha violent jerk the girl at the next table had turned partlyround and was looking at him it was the girl with dark hairshe was looking at him in a sidelong way but with curiousintensity the instant she caught his eye she looked awayagainthe sweat started out on winstons backbone a horrible pang of terror went through him it was gone almost atonce but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind whywas she watching him why did she keep following himabout unfortunately he could not remember whether shehad already been at the table when he arrived or had comethere afterwards but yesterday at any rate during the twominutes hate she had sat immediately behind him whenthere was no apparent need to do so quite likely her realobject had been to listen to him and make sure whether hewas shouting loudly enoughhis earlier thought returned to him probably she wasnot actually a member of the thought police but then itwas precisely the amateur spy who was the greatest dangerof all he did not know how long she had been looking at781984him but perhaps for as much as five minutes and it waspossible that his features had not been perfectly under control it was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wanderwhen you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen the smallest thing could give you away a nervoustic an unconscious look of anxiety a habit of muttering toyourself—anything that carried with it the suggestion ofabnormality of having something to hide in any case towear an improper expression on your face to look incredulous when a victory was announced for example was itselfa punishable offence there was even a word for it in newspeak facecrime it was calledthe girl had turned her back on him again perhaps afterall she was not really following him about perhaps it wascoincidence that she had sat so close to him two days running his cigarette had gone out and he laid it carefully onthe edge of the table he would finish smoking it after workif he could keep the tobacco in it quite likely the personat the next table was a spy of the thought police and quitelikely he would be in the cellars of the ministry of lovewithin three days but a cigarette end must not be wastedsyme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away inhis pocket parsons had begun talking againdid i ever tell you old boy he said chuckling round thestem of his pipe about the time

twice as muchas with her ear to the hole of course its only a toy mindyou still gives em the right idea ehat this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistleit was the signal to return to work all three men sprang totheir feet to join in the struggle round the lifts and the remaining tobacco fell out of winstons cigarette801984chapter 6winston was writing in his diaryit was three years ago it was on a dark evening in anarrow sidestreet near one of the big railway stations shewas standing near a doorway in the wall under a street lampthat hardly gave any light she had a young face paintedvery thick it was really the paint that appealed to me thewhiteness of it like a mask and the bright red lips partywomen never paint their faces there was nobody else in thestreet and no telescreens she said two dollars i——for the moment it was too difficult to go on he shut hiseyes and pressed his fingers against them trying to squeezeout the vision that kept recurring he had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at thetop of his voice or to bang his head against the wall to kickover the table and hurl the inkpot through the window—todo any violent or noisy or painful thing that might blackout the memory that was tormenting himyour worst enemy he reflected was your own nervoussystem at any moment the tension inside you was liable totranslate itself into some visible symptom he thought ofa man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks backa quite ordinarylooking man a party member aged thirfree ebooks at planet ebookcom81tyfive to forty tallish and thin carrying a briefcase theywere a few metres apart when the left side of the mans facewas suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm it happenedagain just as they were passing one another it was only atwitch a quiver rapid as the clicking of a camera shutterbut obviously habitual he remembered thinking at thetime that poor devil is done for and what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly unconscious themost deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep therewas no way of guarding against that so far as he could seehe drew his breath and went on writingi went with her through the doorway and across a backyardinto a basement kitchen there was a bed against the walland a lamp on the table turned down very low she——his teeth were set on edge he would have liked to spitsimultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchenhe thought of katharine his wife winston was married—had been married at any rate probably he still was marriedso far as he knew his wife was not dead he seemed tobreathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes andvillainous cheap scent but nevertheless alluring becauseno woman of the party ever used scent or could be imagined as doing so only the proles used scent in his mind thesmell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornicationwhen he had gone with that woman it had been his firstlapse in two years or thereabouts consorting with prosti821984tutes was forbidden of course but it was one of those rulesthat you could occasionally nerve yourself to break it wasdangerous but it was not a lifeanddeath matter to becaught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forcedlabour camp not more if you had committed no otheroffence and it was easy enough provided that you couldavoid being caught in the act the poorer quarters swarmedwith women who were ready to sell themselves some couldeven be purchased for a bottle of gin which the proles werenot supposed to drink tacitly the party was even inclinedto encourage prostitution as an outlet for instincts whichcould not be altogether suppressed mere debauchery didnot matter very much so long as it was furtive and joylessand only involved the women of a submerged and despisedclass the unforgivable crime was promiscuity betweenparty members but—though this was one of the crimesthat the accused in the great purges invariably confessedto—it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happeningthe aim of the party was not merely to prevent men andwomen from forming loyalties which it might not be ableto control its real undeclared purpose was to remove allpleasure from the sexual act not love so much as eroticism was the enemy inside marriage as well as outside itall marriages between party members had to be approvedby a committee appointed for the purpose and—thoughthe principle was never clearly stated—permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impressionof being physically attracted to one another the only recfree ebooks at planet ebookcom83ognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for theservice of the party sexual intercourse was to be looked onas a slightly disgusting minor operation like having an enema this again was never put into plain words but in anindirect way it was rubbed into every party member fromchildhood onwards there were even organizations suchas the junior antisex league which advocated completecelibacy for both sexes all children were to be begottenby artificial insemination artsem it was called in newspeak and brought up in public institutions this winstonwas aware was not meant altogether seriously but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the party theparty was trying to kill the sex instinct or if it could not bekilled then to distort it and dirty it he did not know whythis was so but it seemed natural that it should be so andas far as the women were concerned the partys efforts werelargely successfulhe thought again of katharine it must be nine ten—nearly eleven years since they had parted it was curioushow seldom he thought of her for days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married they hadonly been together for about fifteen months the party didnot permit divorce but it rather encouraged separation incases where there were no childrenkatharine was a tall fairhaired girl very straight withsplendid movements she had a bold aquiline face a facethat one might have called noble until one discovered thatthere was as nearly as possible nothing behind it very earlyin her married life he had decided—though perhaps it was841984only that he knew her more intimately than he knew mostpeople—that she had without exception the most stupidvulgar empty mind that he had ever encountered she hadnot a thought in her head that was not a slogan and therewas no imbecility absolutely none that she was not capableof swallowing if the party handed it out to her the human soundtrack he nicknamed her in his own mind yethe could have endured living with her if it had not been forjust one thing—sexas soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen to embrace her was like embracing a jointed woodenimage and what was strange was that even when she wasclasping him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength therigidlty of her muscles managed to convey that impression she would lie there with shut eyes neither resistingnor cooperating but submitting it was extraordinarily embarrassing and after a while horrible but even thenhe could have borne living with her if it had been agreedthat they should remain celibate but curiously enough itwas katharine who refused this they must she said produce a child if they could so the performance continued tohappen once a week quite regulariy whenever it was notimpossible she even used to remind him of it in the morning as something which had to be done that evening andwhich must not be forgotten she had two names for it onewas making a baby and the other was our duty to the party yes she had actually used that phrase quite soon hegrew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointedfree ebooks at planet ebookcom85day came round but luckily no child appeared and in theend she agreed to give up trying and soon afterwards theypartedwinston sighed inaudibly he picked up his pen againand wroteshe threw herself down on the bed and at once without anykind of preliminary in the most coarse horrible way you canimagine pulled up her skirt i——he saw himself standing there in the dim lamplightwith the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils andin his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which evenat that moment was mixed up with the thought of katharines white body frozen for ever by the hypnotic powerof the party why did it always have to be like this whycould he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthyscuffles at intervals of years but a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event the women of the party were allalike chastity was as deep ingrained in them as party loyalty by careful early conditioning by games and cold waterby the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and inthe spies and the youth league by lectures parades songsslogans and martial music the natural feeling had beendriven out of them his reason told him that there must beexceptions but his heart did not believe it they were all impregnable as the party intended that they should be andwhat he wanted more even than to be loved was to breakdown that wall of virtue even if it were only once in his861984whole life the sexual act successfully performed was rebellion desire was thoughtcrime even to have awakenedkatharine if he could have achieved it would have beenlike a seduction although she was his wifebut the rest of the story had got to be written down hewrotei turned up the lamp when i saw her in the light——after the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamphad seemed very bright for the first time he could see thewoman properly he had taken a step towards her and thenhalted full of lust and terror he was painfully conscious ofthe risk he had taken in coming here it was perfectly possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out forthat matter they might be waiting outside the door at thismoment if he went away without even doing what he hadcome here to do——it had got to be written down it had got to be confessedwhat he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that thewoman was old the paint was plastered so thick on herface that it looked as though it might crack like a cardboardmask there were streaks of white in her hair but the trulydreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little openrevealing nothing except a cavernous blackness she had noteeth at allhe wrote hurriedly in scrabbling handwritingwhen i saw her in the light she was quite an old woman fiftyfree ebooks at planet ebookcom87years old at least but i went ahead and did it just the samehe pressed his fingers against his eyelids again he hadwritten it down at last but it made no difference the therapy had not worked the urge to shout filthy words at the topof his voice was as strong as ever881984chapter 7if there is hope wrote winston it lies in the prolesif there was hope it must lie in the proles becauseonly there in those swarming disregarded masses 85 percent of the population of oceania could the force to destroy the party ever be generated the party could not beoverthrown from within its enemies if it had any enemieshad no way of coming together or even of identifying oneanother even if the legendary brotherhood existed as justpossibly it might it was inconceivable that its memberscould ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threesrebellion meant a look in the eyes an

and shake themselves like a horse shaking off fliesif they chose they could blow the party to pieces tomorrowmorning surely sooner or later it must occur to them to doit and yet——he remembered how once he had been walking downa crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds ofvoices womens voices—had burst from a sidestreet a littleway ahead it was a great formidable cry of anger and despair a deep loud ohooooh that went humming onlike the reverberation of a bell his heart had leapt its startfree ebooks at planet ebookcom89ed he had thought a riot the proles are breaking looseat last when he had reached the spot it was to see a mobof two or three hundred women crowding round the stallsof a street market with faces as tragic as though they hadbeen the doomed passengers on a sinking ship but at thismoment the general despair broke down into a multitudeof individual quarrels it appeared that one of the stallshad been selling tin saucepans they were wretched flimsythings but cookingpots of any kind were always difficultto get now the supply had unexpectedly given out thesuccessful women bumped and jostled by the rest weretrying to make off with their saucepans while dozens ofothers clamoured round the stall accusing the stallkeeperof favouritism and of having more saucepans somewherein reserve there was a fresh outburst of yells two bloated women one of them with her hair coming down hadgot hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear itout of one anothers hands for a moment they were bothtugging and then the handle came off winston watchedthem disgustedly and yet just for a moment what almostfrightening power had sounded in that cry from only a fewhundred throats why was it that they could never shoutlike that about anything that matteredhe wroteuntil they become conscious they will never rebel and untilafter they have rebelled they can not become consciousthat he reflected might almost have been a transcrip901984tion from one of the party textbooks the party claimed ofcourse to have liberated the proles from bondage beforethe revolution they had been hideously oppressed by thecapitalists they had been starved and flogged women hadbeen forced to work in the coal mines women still did workin the coal mines as a matter of fact children had beensold into the factories at the age of six but simultaneously true to the principles of doublethink the party taughtthat the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept insubjection like animals by the application of a few simplerules in reality very little was known about the proles itwas not necessary to know much so long as they continued to work and breed their other activities were withoutimportance left to themselves like cattle turned looseupon the plains of

quarrels with neighbours films football beer and above all gambling filled up the horizonof their minds to keep them in control was not difficulta few agents of the thought police moved always amongthem spreading false rumours and marking down andeliminating the few individuals who were judged capable ofbecoming dangerous but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the party it was not desirablefree ebooks at planet ebookcom91that the proles should have strong political feelings all thatwas required of them was a primitive patriotism whichcould be appealed to whenever it was necessary to makethem accept longer workinghours or shorter rations andeven when they became discontented as they sometimesdid their discontent led nowhere because being withoutgeneral ideas they could only focus it on petty specificgrievances the larger evils invariably escaped their noticethe great majority of proles did not even have telescreens intheir homes even the civil

it all happened among the proles themselves it wasof no importance in all questions of morals they were allowed to follow their ancestral code the sexual puritanismof the party was not imposed upon

suspicion as the party slogan put it proles andanimals are freewinston reached down and cautiously scratched hisvaricose ulcer it had begun itching again the thing youinvariably came back to was the impossibility of knowingwhat life before the revolution had really been like he tookout of the drawer a copy of a childrens history textbookwhich he had borrowed from mrs parsons and began copying a passage into the diary921984in the old days it ran before the glorious revolutionlondon was not the beautiful city that we know today itwas a dark dirty miserable place where hardly anybodyhad enough

flogged them with whipsif they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stalebreadcrusts and water but in among all this terrible povertythere were just a few great big beautiful houses that

you tell how much of it was lies it mightbe true that the average human being was better off nowthan he had been before the revolution the only evidenceto the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones theinstinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at some other time they must have beendifferent it struck him that the truly characteristic thingabout modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity butsimply its bareness its dinginess its listlessness life if youlooked about you bore no resemblance not only to the liesthat streamed out of the telescreens but even to the idealsthat the party was trying to achieve great areas of it evenfor a party member were neutral and nonpolitical a matter of slogging through dreary jobs fighting for a place onthe tube darning a wornout sock cadging a saccharinetablet saving a cigarette end the ideal set up by the party was something huge terrible and glittering—a world ofsteel and concrete of monstrous machines and terrifyingweapons—a nation of warriors and fanatics marching forward in perfect unity all thinking the same thoughts andshouting the same slogans perpetually working fightingtriumphing persecuting—three hundred million people allwith the same face the reality was decaying dingy cities941984where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky shoesin patchedup nineteenthcentury houses

food more clothesbetter houses better recreations—that they lived longerworked shorter hours were bigger healthier stronger happier more intelligent better educated than the people offifty years ago not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved the party claimed for example that today 40 percent of adult proles were literate before the revolution itwas said the number had only been 15 per cent the partyclaimed that the infant mortality rate was now only 160 perthousand whereas before the revolution it had been 300—and so it went on it was like a single equation with twounknowns it

            "Chapter 7 content: years earlierthe story really began in the middle sixties the period ofthe great purges in which the original leaders of the revolution were wiped out once and for all by 1970 none of themwas left except big brother himself all the rest had by thattime been exposed as traitors and counterrevolutionaries goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew whereand of the others a few had simply disappeared while themajority had been executed after spectacular public trialsat which they made confession of their crimes among thelast survivors were three men named jones aaronson andrutherford it must have been in 1965 that these three hadbeen arrested as often happened they had vanished for ayear or more so that one did not know whether they werealive or dead and then had suddenly been brought forthto incriminate themselves in the usual way they had confessed to intelligence with the enemy at that date too theenemy was eurasia embezzlement of public funds themurder of various trusted party members intrigues againstthe leadership of big brother which had started long beforethe revolution happened and acts of sabotage causing thedeath of hundreds of thousands of people after confessing to these things they had been pardoned reinstated inthe party and given posts which were in fact sinecures butwhich sounded important all three had written long

figures left over from the heroic days of the party theglamour of the underground struggle and the civil war stillfaintly clung to them he had the feeling though already atthat time facts and dates were growing blurry that he hadknown their names years earlier than he had known that ofbig brother but also they were outlaws enemies untouchables doomed with absolute certainty to extinction withina

them itwas not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood of suchpeople they were sitting in silence before glasses of the ginflavoured with cloves which was the speciality of the cafeof the three it

hopeless effort to get back into the pasthe was a monstrous man with a mane of greasy grey hairhis face pouched and seamed with thick negroid lips atone time he must have been immensely strong now hisgreat body was sagging sloping bulging falling away inevery direction he seemed to be breaking up before oneseyes like a mountain crumblingit was the lonely hour of fifteen winston could notnow remember how he had come to be in the cafe at sucha time the place was almost empty a tinny music wastrickling from the telescreens the three men sat in theircorner almost motionless never speaking uncommandedthe waiter brought fresh glasses of gin there was a chessboard on the table beside them with the pieces set out butno game started and then for perhaps half a minute in allsomething happened to the telescreens the tune that theywere playing changed and the tone of the music changedtoo there came into it—but it was something hard to describe it was a peculiar cracked braying jeering note inhis mind winston called it a yellow note and then a voicefrom the telescreen was singingunder the spreading chestnut treei sold you and you sold methere lie they and here lie weunder the spreading chestnut tree981984the three men never stirred but when winston glancedagain at rutherfords ruinous face he saw that his eyeswere full of tears and for the first time he noticed with akind of inward shudder and yet not knowing at whathe shuddered that both aaronson and rutherford had broken nosesa little later all three were rearrested it appeared thatthey had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release at their second trial they confessed toall their old crimes over again with a whole string of newones they were executed and their fate was recorded inthe party histories a warning to posterity about five yearsafter this in 1973 winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube onto his desk when he came on a fragment of paper whichhad evidently been slipped in among the others and thenforgotten the instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance it was a halfpage torn out of the times of aboutten years earlier—the top half of the page so that it includedthe date—and it contained a photograph of the delegates atsome party function in new york prominent in the middleof the group were jones aaronson and rutherford therewas no mistaking them in any case their names were in thecaption at the bottomthe point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that date they had been on eurasian soil theyhad flown from a secret airfield in canada to a rendezvoussomewhere in siberia and had conferred with members ofthe eurasian general staff to whom they had betrayed imfree ebooks at planet ebookcom99portant military secrets the date had stuck in winstonsmemory because it chanced to be midsummer day but thewhole story must be on record in countless other places aswell there was only one possible conclusion the confessions were liesof course this was not in itself a discovery even at thattime winston had not imagined that the people who werewiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimesthat they were accused of but this was concrete evidenceit was a fragment of the abolished past like a fossil bonewhich turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory it was enough to blow the party to atoms ifin some way it could have been published to the world andits significance made knownhe had gone straight on working as soon as he saw whatthe photograph was and what it meant he had covered itup with another sheet of paper luckily when he unrolledit it had been upsidedown from the point of view of thetelescreenhe took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed backhis chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible to keep your face expressionless was not difficult andeven your breathing could be controlled with an effortbut you could not control the beating of your heart andthe telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up helet what he judged to be ten minutes go by tormented allthe while by the fear that some accident—a sudden draughtblowing across his desk for instance—would betray himthen without uncovering it again he dropped the photo1001984graph into the memory hole along with some other wastepapers within another minute perhaps it would havecrumbled into ashesthat was ten—eleven years ago today probably hewould have kept that photograph it was curious that thefact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to makea difference even now when the photograph itself as wellas the event it recorded was only memory was the partyshold upon the past less strong he wondered because a pieceof evidence which existed no longer had once existedbut today supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes the photograph might not even beevidence already at the time when he made his discovery oceania was no longer at war with eurasia and it musthave been to the agents of eastasia that the three dead menhad betrayed their country since then there had been other changes—two three he could not remember how manyvery likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewrittenuntil the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest significance the past not only changed but changedcontinuously what most afflicted him with the sense ofnightmare was that he had never clearly understood whythe huge imposture was undertaken the immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious but the ultimatemotive was mysterious he took up his pen again andwrotei understand how i do not understand whyfree ebooks at planet ebookcom101he wondered as he had many times wondered beforewhether he himself was a lunatic perhaps a lunatic wassimply a minority of one at one time it had been a sign ofmadness to believe that the earth goes round the sun todayto believe that the past is inalterable he might be alonein holding that belief and if alone then a lunatic but thethought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him thehorror was that he might also be wronghe picked up the childrens history book and looked atthe portrait of big brother which formed its frontispiecethe hypnotic eyes gazed into his own it was as thoughsome huge force were pressing

would announce that two and two made five and youwould have to believe it it was inevitable that they shouldmake that claim sooner or later the logic of their positiondemanded it not merely the validity of experience but thevery existence of external reality was tacitly denied by theirphilosophy the heresy of heresies was common sense andwhat was terrifying was not that they would kill you forthinking otherwise but that they might be right for afterall how do we know that two and two make four or thatthe force of gravity works or that the past is unchangeable if both the past and the external world exist only inthe mind and if the mind itself is controllable what thenbut no his courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of itsown accord the face of obrien not called up by any

the smell ofroasting coffee—real coffee not victory coffee—camefloating out into the street winston paused involuntarilyfor perhaps two seconds he was back in the halfforgottenworld of his childhood then a door banged seeming to cutoff the smell as abruptly as though it had been a soundhe had walked several kilometres over pavements andhis varicose ulcer was throbbing this was the second timein three weeks that he had missed an evening at the community centre a rash act since you could be certain thatthe number of your attendances at the centre was carefully checked in principle a party member had no sparetime and was never alone except in bed it was assumedthat when he was not working eating or sleeping he wouldbe taking part in some kind of communal recreation to doanything that suggested a taste for solitude even to go for awalk by yourself was always slightly dangerous there wasa word for it in newspeak ownlife it was called meaning individualism and eccentricity but this evening as hecame out of the ministry the balminess of the april air hadtempted him the sky was a warmer blue than he had seen itthat year and suddenly the long noisy evening at the centre the boring exhausting games the lectures the creakingcamaraderie oiled by gin had seemed intolerable on im1041984pulse he had turned away from the busstop and wanderedoff into the labyrinth of london first south then east thennorth again losing himself among unknown streets andhardly bothering in which direction he was goingif there is hope he had written in the diary it lies inthe proles the words kept coming back to him statementof a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity he was somewhere in the vague browncoloured slums to the north andeast of what had once been saint pancras station he waswalking up a cobbled street of little twostorey houses withbattered doorways which gave straight on the pavementand which were somehow curiously suggestive of ratholesthere were puddles of filthy water here and there among thecobbles in and out of the dark doorways and down narrowalleyways that branched off on either side people swarmedin astonishing numbers—girls in full bloom with crudely lipsticked mouths and youths who chased the girls andswollen waddling women who showed you what the girlswould be like in ten years time and old bent creatures shuffling along on splayed feet and ragged barefooted childrenwho played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yellsfrom their mothers perhaps a quarter of the windows inthe street were broken and boarded up most of the peoplepaid no attention to winston a few eyed him with a sort ofguarded curiosity two monstrous women with brickredforearms folded across thelr aprons were talking outside adoorway winston caught scraps of

says but you aint got the same problems as what i gotah said the other thats jest it thats jest where it isthe strident voices stopped abruptly the women studied him in hostile silence as he went past but it was nothostility exactly merely a kind of wariness a momentarystiffening as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal theblue overalls of the party could not be a common sight ina street like

applied to rocket bombs winston promptly flunghimself on his face the proles were nearly always rightwhen they gave you a warning of this kind they seemedto possess some kind of instinct which told them severalseconds in advance when a rocket was coming althoughthe rockets supposedly travelled faster than sound winston clasped his forearms above his head there was a roarthat seemed to make the pavement heave a shower of lightobjects pattered on to his back when he stood up he foundthat he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest windowhe walked on the bomb had demolished a group ofhouses 200 metres up the street a black plume of smokehung in the sky and below it a cloud of plaster dust in whicha crowd was already forming around the ruins there was alittle pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him andin the middle of it he could see a bright red streak when hegot up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at thewrist apart from the bloody stump the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster casthe kicked the thing into the gutter and then to avoidthe crowd turned down a sidestreet to the right within three or four minutes he was out of the area which thebomb had affected and the sordid swarming life of thestreets was going on as though nothing had happened itwas nearly twenty hours and the drinkingshops which theproles frequented

angle formed by a projectinghousefront three men were standing very close together the middle one of them holding a foldedup newspaperwhich the other two were studying over his shoulder evenbefore he was near enough to make out the expression ontheir faces winston could see absorption in every line oftheir bodies it was obviously some serious piece of newsthat they were reading he was a few paces away from themwhen suddenly the group broke up and two of the men werein violent altercation for a moment they seemed almost onthe point of blowscant you bleeding well listen to what i say i tell

grandmother i got it all down in blackand white an i tell you no number——oh pack it in said the third manthey were talking about the lottery winston lookedback when he had gone thirty metres they were still arguing with vivid passionate faces the lottery with itsweekly payout of enormous prizes was the one public event1081984to which the proles paid serious attention it was probablethat there were some millions of proles for whom the lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remainingalive it was their delight their folly their anodyne theirintellectual stimulant where the lottery was concernedeven people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memorythere was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply byselling systems forecasts and lucky amulets winston hadnothing to do with the running of the lottery which wasmanaged by the ministry of plenty but he was aware indeed everyone in the party was aware that the prizes werelargely imaginary only small sums were actually paid outthe winners of the big prizes being nonexistent persons inthe absence of any real intercommunication between onepart of oceania and another this was not difficult to arrangebut if there was hope it lay in the proles you had to clingon to that when you put it in words it sounded reasonableit was when you looked at the human beings passing you onthe pavement that it became an act of faith the street intowhich he had turned ran downhill he had a feeling that hehad been in this neighbourhood before and that there wasa main thoroughfare not far away from somewhere aheadthere came a din of shouting voices the street took a sharpturn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down intoa sunken alley where a few stallkeepers were selling tiredlooking vegetables at this moment winston rememberedwhere he was the alley led out into the main street andfree ebooks at planet ebookcom109down the next turning not five minutes away was the junkshop where he had bought the blank book which was nowhis diary and in a small stationers shop not far away hehad bought his penholder and his bottle of inkhe paused for a moment at the top of the steps on theopposite side of the alley there was a dingy little pub whosewindows appeared to be frosted over but in reality weremerely coated with dust a very old man bent but activewith white moustaches that bristled forward like those of aprawn pushed open the swing door and went in as winston stood watching it occurred to him that the old manwho must be eighty at the least had already been middleaged when the revolution happened he and a few otherslike him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of capitalism in the party itself there were notmany people left whose ideas had been formed before therevolution the older generation had mostly been wiped outin the great purges of the fifties and sixties and the few whosurvived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual surrender if there was any one still alive who couldgive you a truthful account of conditions in the early partof the century it could only be a prole suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into his diarycame back into winstons mind and a lunatic impulse tookhold of him he would go into the pub he would scrape acquaintance with that old man and question him he wouldsay to him tell me about your life when you were a boywhat was it like in those days were things better than theyare now or were they worse1101984hurriedly lest he should have time to become frightenedhe descended the steps and crossed the narrow street itwas madness of course as usual there was no definite ruleagainst talking to proles and frequenting their pubs but itwas far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed if the patrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness but itwas not likely that they would believe him he pushed openthe door and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit him inthe face as he entered the din of voices dropped to abouthalf its volume behind his back he could feel everyone eyeing his blue overalls a game of darts which was going on atthe other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps asmuch as thirty seconds the old man whom he had followedwas standing at the bar having some kind of altercationwith

obriens political orthodoxy wasnot perfect something in his face suggested it irresistibly141984and again perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that waswritten in his face but simply intelligence but at any ratehe had the appearance of being a person that you couldtalk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and gethim alone winston had never made the smallest effort toverify this guess indeed there was no way of doing so atthis moment obrien glanced at his wristwatch saw that itwas nearly eleven hundred and evidently decided to stay inthe records department until the two minutes hate wasover he took a chair in the same row as winston a coupleof places away a small sandyhaired woman who workedin the next cubicle to winston was between them the girlwith dark hair was sitting immediately behindthe next moment a hideous grinding speech as of somemonstrous machine running without oil burst from thebig telescreen at the end of the room it was a noise that setones teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of onesneck the hate had startedas usual the face of emmanuel goldstein the enemy ofthe people had flashed on to the screen there were hisseshere and there among the audience the little sandyhairedwoman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once long agohow long ago nobody quite remembered had been one ofthe leading figures of the party almost on a level with bigbrother himself and then had engaged in counterrevolutionary activities had been condemned to death and hadmysteriously escaped and disappeared the programmes ofthe two minutes hate varied from day to day but there wasfree ebooks at planet ebookcom15none in which goldstein was not the principal figure hewas the primal traitor the earliest defiler of the partys purity all subsequent crimes against the party all treacheriesacts of sabotage heresies deviations sprang directly outof his teaching somewhere or other he was still alive andhatching his conspiracies perhaps somewhere beyond thesea under the protection of his foreign paymasters perhapseven—so it was occasionally rumoured—in some hidingplace in oceania itselfwinstons diaphragm was constricted he could neversee the face of goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions it was a lean jewish face with a great fuzzy aureole ofwhite hair and a small goatee beard—a clever face and yetsomehow inherently despicable with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose near the end of which a pairof spectacles was perched it resembled the face of a sheepand the voice too had a sheeplike quality goldstein wasdelivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrinesof the party—an attack so exaggerated and perverse that achild should have been able to see through it and yet justplausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling thatother people less levelheaded than oneself might be takenin by it he was abusing big brother he was denouncingthe dictatorship of the party he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with eurasia he was advocatingfreedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of thought he was crying hysterically thatthe revolution had been betrayed—and all this in rapidpolysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the ha161984bitual style of the orators of the party and even containednewspeak words more newspeak words indeed than anyparty member would normally use in real life and all thewhile lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality whichgoldsteins specious claptrap covered behind his head onthe telescreen there marched the endless columns of theeurasian army—row after row of solidlooking men withexpressionless asiatic faces who swam up to the surfaceof the screen and vanished to be replaced by others exactly similar the dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers bootsformed the background to goldsteins bleating voicebefore the hate had proceeded for thirty seconds uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from halfthe people in the room the selfsatisfied sheeplike face onthe screen and the terrifying power of the eurasian armybehind it were too much to be borne besides the sight oreven the thought of goldstein produced fear and anger automatically he was an object of hatred more constant thaneither eurasia or eastasia since when oceania was at warwith one of these powers it was generally at peace with theother but what was strange was that although goldsteinwas hated and despised by everybody although every dayand a thousand times a day on platforms on the telescreenin newspapers in books his theories were refuted smashedridiculed held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were—in spite of all this his influence neverseemed to grow less always there were fresh dupes waitingto be seduced by him a day never passed when spies andsaboteurs acting under his directions were not unmaskedfree ebooks at planet ebookcom17by the thought police he was the commander of a vastshadowy army an underground network of conspiratorsdedicated to the overthrow of the state the brotherhoodits name was supposed to be there were also whisperedstories of a terrible book a compendium of all the heresiesof which goldstein was the author and which circulatedclandestinely here and there it was a book without a titlepeople referred to it if at all simply as the book but oneknew of such things only through vague rumours neitherthe brotherhood nor the book was a subject that any ordinary party member would mention if there was a way ofavoiding itin its second minute the hate rose to a frenzy peoplewere leaping up and down in their places and shoutingat the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen thelittle sandyhaired woman had turned bright pink andher mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landedfish even obriens heavy face was flushed he was sittingvery straight in his chair his powerful chest swelling andquivering as though he were standing up to the assault of awave the darkhaired girl behind winston had begun crying out swine swine swine and suddenly she picked upa heavy newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen itstruck goldsteins nose and bounced off the voice continued inexorably in a lucid moment winston found that hewas shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair the horrible thing aboutthe two minutes hate was not that one was obliged to act181984a part but on the contrary that it was impossible to avoidjoining in within thirty seconds any pretence was alwaysunnecessary a hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictivenessa desire to kill to torture to smash faces in with a sledgehammer seemed to flow through the whole group of peoplelike an electric current turning one even against ones willinto a grimacing screaming lunatic and yet the rage thatone felt was an abstract undirected emotion which couldbe switched from one object to another like the flame of ablowlamp thus at one moment winstons hatred was notturned against goldstein at all but on the contrary againstbig brother the party and the thought police and at suchmoments his heart went out to the lonely derided hereticon the screen sole guardian of truth and sanity in a worldof lies and yet the very next instant he was at one with thepeople about him and all that was said of goldstein seemedto him to be true at those moments his secret loathing ofbig brother changed into adoration and big brother seemedto tower up an invincible fearless protector standing likea rock against the hordes of asia and goldstein in spiteof his isolation his helplessness and the doubt that hungabout his very existence seemed like some sinister enchanter capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking thestructure of civilizationit was even possible at moments to switch ones hatred this way or that by a voluntary act suddenly by thesort of violent effort with which one wrenches ones headaway from the pillow in a nightmare winston succeededin transferring his hatred from the face on the screen tofree ebooks at planet ebookcom19the darkhaired girl behind him vivid beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind he would flog her to deathwith a rubber truncheon he would tie her naked to a stakeand shoot her full of arrows like saint sebastian he wouldravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax better than before moreover he realized why it was that hehated her he hated her because she was young and prettyand sexless because he wanted to go to bed with her andwould never do so because round her sweet supple waistwhich seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm therewas only the odious scarlet sash aggressive symbol of chastitythe hate rose to its climax the voice of goldstein hadbecome an actual sheeps bleat and for an instant the facechanged into that of a sheep then the sheepface melted intothe figure of a eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancinghuge and terrible his submachine gun roaring and seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen so that someof the people in the front row actually flinched backwardsin their seats but in the same moment drawing a deep sighof relief from everybody the hostile figure melted into theface of big brother blackhaired blackmoustachiod fullof power and mysterious calm and so vast that it almostfilled up the screen nobody heard what big brother wassaying it was merely a few words of encouragement thesort of words that are uttered in the din of battle not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the factof being spoken then the face of big brother faded awayagain and instead the three slogans of the party stood out201984in bold capitalswar is peacefreedom is slaveryignorance is strengthbut the face of big brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen as though the impact that it hadmade on everyones eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately the little sandyhaired woman had flung herselfforward over the back of the chair in front of her with atremulous murmur that sounded like my saviour she extended her arms towards the screen then she buried herface in her hands it was apparent that she was uttering aprayerat this moment the entire group of people broke into adeep slow rhythmical chant of bbbb—over and overagain very slowly with a long pause between the first band the second—a heavy murmurous sound somehowcuriously savage in the background of which one seemedto hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tomtoms for perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept itup it was a refrain that was often heard in moments ofoverwhelming emotion partly it was a sort of hymn to thewisdom and majesty of big brother but still more it wasan act of selfhypnosis a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise winstons entrails seemedto grow cold in the two minutes hate he could not helpsharing in the general delirium but this subhuman chantfree ebooks at planet ebookcom21ing of bbbb always filled him with horror of coursehe chanted with the rest it was impossible to do otherwiseto dissemble your feelings to control your face to do whateveryone else was doing was an instinctive reaction butthere was a space of a couple of seconds during which theexpression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed himand it was exactly at this moment that the significant thinghappened—if indeed it did happenmomentarily he caught obriens eye obrien had stoodup he had taken off his spectacles and was in the act ofresettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesturebut there was a fraction of a second when their eyes metand for as long as it took to happen winston knew—yes heknew—that obrien was thinking the same thing as himself an unmistakable message had passed it was as thoughtheir two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowingfrom one into the other through their eyes i am with youobrien seemed to be saying to him i know precisely whatyou are feeling i know all about your contempt your hatred your disgust but dont worry i am on your side andthen the flash of intelligence was gone and obriens facewas as inscrutable as everybody elsesthat was all and he was already uncertain whether it hadhappened such incidents never had any sequel all that theydid was to keep alive in him the belief or hope that others besides himself were the enemies of the party perhapsthe rumours of vast underground conspiracies were trueafter all—perhaps the brotherhood really existed it wasimpossible in spite of the endless arrests and confessions221984and executions to be sure that the brotherhood was notsimply a myth some days he believed in it some days notthere was no evidence only fleeting glimpses that mightmean anything or nothing snatches of overheard conversation faint scribbles on lavatory walls—once even whentwo strangers met a small movement of the hand whichhad looked as though it might be a signal of recognition itwas all guesswork very likely he had imagined everythinghe had gone back to his cubicle without looking at obrienagain the idea of following up their momentary contacthardly crossed his mind it would have been inconceivablydangerous even if he had known how to set about doing itfor a second two seconds they had exchanged an equivocal glance and that was the end of the story but even thatwas a memorable event in the locked loneliness in whichone had to livewinston roused himself and sat up straighter he let outa belch the gin was rising from his stomachhis eyes refocused on the page he discovered thatwhile he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing asthough by automatic action and it was no longer the samecramped awkward handwriting as before his pen had slidvoluptuously over the smooth paper printing in large neatcapitals—down with big brother down withbig brother down with big brother downwith big brother down with big brotherover and over again filling half a pagehe could not help feeling a twinge of panic it was absurd since the writing of those particular words was notfree ebooks at planet ebookcom23more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diarybut for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiledpages and abandon the enterprise altogetherhe did not do so however because he knew that it wasuseless whether he wrote down with big brotheror whether he refrained from writing it made no difference whether he went on with the diary or whether he didnot go on with it made no difference the thought policewould get him just the same he had committed—wouldstill have committed even if he had never set pen to paper—the essential crime that contained all others in itselfthoughtcrime they called it thoughtcrime was not a thingthat could be concealed for ever you might dodge successfully for a while even for years but sooner or later theywere bound to get youit was always at night—the arrests invariably happenedat night the sudden jerk out of sleep the rough hand shaking your shoulder the lights glaring in your eyes the ring ofhard faces round the bed in the vast majority of cases therewas no trial no report of the arrest people simply disappeared always during the night your name was removedfrom the registers every record of everything you had everdone was wiped out your onetime existence was deniedand then forgotten you were abolished annihilated vaporized was the usual wordfor a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria he began writing in a hurried untidy scrawltheyll shoot me i dont care theyll shoot me in the back of the241984neck i dont care down with big brother they always shoot youin the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother——he sat back in his chair slightly ashamed of himself andlaid down the pen the next moment he started violentlythere was a knocking at the dooralready he sat as still as a mouse in the futile hope thatwhoever it was might go away after a single attempt but nothe knocking was repeated the worst thing of all would beto delay his heart was thumping like a drum but his facefrom long habit was probably expressionless he got up andmoved heavily towards the doorfree ebooks at planet ebookcom25chapter 2as he put his hand to the doorknob winston saw thathe had left the diary open on the table down withbig brother was written all over it in letters almost bigenough to be legible across the room it was an inconceivably stupid thing to have done but he realized even in hispanic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper byshutting the book while the ink was wethe drew in his breath and opened the door instantlya warm wave of relief flowed through him a colourlesscrushedlooking woman with wispy hair and a lined facewas standing outsideoh comrade she began in a dreary whining sort ofvoice i thought i heard you come in do

boiledcabbage smell common to the whole buildingbut it was shot through by a sharper reek of sweat which—one knew this at the first sniff though it was hard to sayhow—was the sweat of some person not present at the moment in another room someone with a comb and a piece oftoilet paper was trying to keep tune with the military musicwhich was still issuing from the telescreenits the children said mrs

imitatingfree ebooks at planet ebookcom29her brother in every movement it was somehow slightlyfrightening like the gambolling of tiger cubs which willsoon grow up into maneaters there was a sort of calculating ferocity in the boys eye a quite evident desire to hit orkick winston and a consciousness of being very nearly bigenough to do so it was a good job it was not a real pistol hewas holding winston thoughtmrs parsons eyes flitted nervously from winston to thechildren and back again in the better light of the livingroom he noticed with interest that there actually was dustin the creases

in the park that evening winston rememberedthis happened about once a month and was a popular spectacle children always clamoured to be taken to see it hetook his leave of mrs parsons and made for the door but hehad not gone six steps down the passage when somethinghit the back of his neck an agonizingly painful blow it wasas though a redhot wire had been jabbed into him he spunround just in time to see mrs parsons dragging her son backinto the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult301984goldstein bellowed the boy as the door closed on himbut what most struck winston was the look of helplessfright on the womans greyish faceback in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreenand sat down at the table again still rubbing his neck themusic from the telescreen had stopped instead a clippedmilitary voice was reading out with a sort of brutal relisha description of the armaments of the new floating fortress which had just been anchored between iceland andthe faroe lslandswith those children he thought that wretched woman must lead a life of terror another year two years andthey would be watching her night and day for symptoms ofunorthodoxy nearly all children nowadays were horriblewhat was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the spies they were systematically turned intoungovernable little savages and yet this produced in themno tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of theparty on the contrary they adored the party and everything connected with it the songs the processions thebanners the hiking the drilling with dummy rifles theyelling of slogans the worship of big brother—it was all asort of glorious game to them all their ferocity was turnedoutwards against the enemies of the state against foreigners traitors saboteurs

describinghow some eavesdropping little sneak—child hero was thefree ebooks at planet ebookcom31phrase generally used—had overheard some compromisingremark and denounced its parents to the thought policethe sting of the catapult bullet had worn off he pickedup his pen halfheartedly wondering whether he could findsomething more to write in the diary suddenly he beganthinking of obrien againyears ago—how long was it seven years it must be—hehad dreamed that he was walking through a pitchdarkroom and someone sitting to one side of him had said ashe passed we shall meet in the place where there is nodarkness it was said very quietly almost casually—a statement not a command he had walked on without pausingwhat was curious was that at the time in the dream thewords had not made much impression on him it was onlylater and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance he could not now remember whether it was beforeor after having the dream that he had seen obrien for thefirst time nor could he remember when he had first identified the voice as obriens but at any rate the identificationexisted it was obrien who had spoken to him out of thedarkwinston had never been able to feel sure—even after thismornings flash of the eyes it was still impossible to be surewhether obrien was a friend or an enemy nor did it evenseem to matter greatly there was a link of understandingbetween them more important than affection or partisanship we shall meet in the place where there is no darknesshe had said winston did not know what it meant only thatin some way or another it would come true321984the voice from the telescreen paused a trumpet callclear and beautiful floated into the stagnant air the voicecontinued raspinglyattention your attention please a

feeling the telescreen—perhaps to celebrate thevictory perhaps to drown the memory of the lost chocolate—crashed into oceania tis for thee you were supposed tostand to attention however in his present

round and the myriad windows ofthe ministry of truth with the light no longer shining on341984them looked grim as the loopholes of a fortress his heartquailed before the enormous pyramidal shape it was toostrong it could not be stormed a thousand rocket bombswould not batter it down he wondered again for whom hewas writing the diary for the future for the past—for anage that might be imaginary

inkstained it was exactly the kind of detailthat might betray you some nosing zealot in the ministrya woman probably someone like the little sandyhairedwoman or the darkhaired girl from the fiction department might start wondering why he had been writingduring the lunch interval why he had used an oldfashioned pen what he had been writing—and then drop ahint in the appropriate quarter he went to the bathroomand carefully scrubbed the ink away with the gritty darkbrown soap which rasped your skin like sandpaper and wastherefore well adapted for this purposehe put the diary away in the drawer it was quite uselessto think of hiding it but he could at least make sure whetheror not its existence had been discovered a hair laid acrossthe pageends was too obvious with the tip of his finger hepicked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and deposited it on the corner of the cover where it was bound to beshaken off if the book was moved361984chapter 3winston was dreaming of his motherhe must he thought have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had disappeared she wasa tall statuesque rather silent woman with slow movements and magnificent fair hair his father he rememberedmore vaguely as dark and thin dressed always in neat darkclothes winston remembered especially the very thin solesof his fathers shoes and wearing spectacles the two ofthem must evidently have been swallowed up in one of thefirst great purges of the fiftiesat this moment his mother was sitting in some placedeep down beneath him with his young sister in her armshe did not remember his sister at all except as a tiny feeblebaby always silent with large watchful eyes both of themwere looking up at him they were down in some subterranean place—the bottom of a well for instance or a verydeep grave—but it was a place which already far below himwas itself moving downwards they were in the saloon ofa sinking ship looking up at him through the darkeningwater there was still air in the saloon they could still seehim and he them but all the while they were sinking downdown into the green waters which in another moment musthide them from sight for ever he was out in the light andair while they were being sucked down to death and theyfree ebooks at planet ebookcom37were down there because he was up here he knew it andthey knew it and he could see the knowledge in their facesthere was no reproach either in their faces or in their heartsonly the knowledge that they must die in order that hemight remain alive and that this was part of the unavoidable order of thingshe could not remember what had happened but he knewin his dream that in some way the lives of his mother andhis sister had been sacrificed to his own it was one of thosedreams which while retaining the characteristic dreamscenery are a continuation of ones intellectual life andin which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which stillseem new and valuable after one is awake the thing thatnow suddenly struck winston was that his mothers deathnearly thirty years ago had been tragic and sorrowful in away that was no longer possible tragedy he perceived belonged to the ancient time to a time when there was stillprivacy love and friendship and when the members of afamily stood by one another without needing to know thereason his mothers memory tore at his heart because shehad died loving him when he was too young and selfishto love her in return and because somehow he did not remember how she had sacrificed herself to a conception ofloyalty that was private and unalterable such things hesaw could not happen today today there were fear hatredand pain but no dignity of emotion no deep or complexsorrows all this he seemed to see in the large eyes of hismother and his sister looking up at him through the greenwater hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking381984suddenly he was standing on short springy turf on asummer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gildedthe ground the landscape that he was looking at recurredso often in his dreams that he was never fully certainwhether or not he had seen it in the real world in his waking thoughts he called it the golden country it was an oldrabbitbitten pasture with a foottrack wandering across itand a molehill here and there in the ragged hedge on theopposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees wereswaying very faintly in the breeze their leaves just stirringin dense masses like womens hair somewhere near at handthough out of sight there was a clear slowmoving streamwhere dace were swimming in the pools under the willowtreesthe girl with dark hair was coming towards them acrossthe field with what seemed a single movement she tore offher clothes and flung them disdainfully aside her bodywas white and smooth but it aroused no desire in him indeed he barely looked at it what overwhelmed him in thatinstant was admiration for the gesture with which she hadthrown her clothes aside with its grace and carelessnessit seemed to annihilate a whole culture a whole systemof thought as though big brother and the party and thethought police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm that too was a gesturebelonging to the ancient time winston woke up with theword shakespeare on his lipsthe telescreen was giving forth an earsplitting whistlewhich continued on the same note for thirty seconds itfree ebooks at planet ebookcom39was nought seven fifteen gettingup time for office workerswinston wrenched his body out of bed—naked for a member of the outer party received only 3000 clothing couponsannually and a suit of pyjamas was 600—and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chairthe physical jerks would begin in three minutes the nextmoment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit whichnearly always attacked him soon after waking up it emptiedhis lungs so completely that he could only begin breathingagain by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gaspshis veins had swelled with the effort of the cough and thevaricose ulcer had started itchingthirty to forty group yapped a piercing female voicethirty to forty

pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out ofwinstons mind the impression made by his dream and therhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhatas he mechanically shot his arms back and forth wearingon his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during the physical jerks he was struggling401984to think his way backward into the dim period of his earlychildhood it was extraordinarily difficult beyond the latefifties everything faded when there were no external records that you could refer to even the outline of your ownlife lost its sharpness you remembered huge events whichhad quite probably not happened you remembered thedetail of incidents without being able to recapture their atmosphere and there were long blank periods to which youcould assign nothing everything had been different theneven the names of countries and their shapes on the maphad been different airstrip one for instance had not beenso called in those days it had been called england or britain though london he felt fairly certain had always beencalled londonwinston could not definitely remember a time when hiscountry had not been at war but it was evident that therehad been a fairly long interval of peace during his childhood because one of his early memories was of an air raidwhich appeared to take everyone by surprise perhaps it wasthe time when the atomic bomb had fallen on colchesterhe did not remember the raid itself but he did rememberhis fathers hand clutching his own as they hurried downdown down into some place deep in the earth round andround a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and whichfinally so wearied his legs that he began whimpering andthey had to stop and rest his mother in her slow dreamyway was following a long way behind them she was carrying his baby sister—or perhaps it was only a bundle ofblankets that she was carrying he was not certain whetherfree ebooks at planet ebookcom41his sister had been born then finally they had emerged intoa noisy crowded place which he had realized to be a tubestationthere were people sitting all over the stoneflagged floorand other people packed tightly together were sitting onmetal bunks one above the other winston and his motherand father found themselves a place on the floor and nearthem an old man and an old woman were sitting side byside on a bunk the old man had on a decent dark suit anda black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair hisface was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears hereeked of gin it seemed to breathe out of his skin in placeof sweat and one could have fancied that the tears wellingfrom his eyes were pure gin but though slightly drunk hewas also suffering under some grief that was genuine andunbearable in his childish way winston grasped that someterrible thing something that was beyond forgiveness andcould never be remedied had just happened it also seemedto him that he knew what it was someone whom the oldman loved—a little granddaughter perhaps—had beenkilled every few minutes the old man kept repeatingwe didnt ought to ave trusted em i said so ma didnt ithats what comes of trusting em i said so all along wedidnt ought to ave trusted the buggersbut which buggers they didnt ought to have trustedwinston could not now remembersince about that time war had been literally continu421984ous though strictly speaking it had not always been thesame war for several months during his childhood therehad been confused street fighting in london itself some ofwhich he remembered vividly but to trace out the historyof the whole period to say who was fighting whom at anygiven moment would have been utterly impossible sinceno written record and no spoken word ever made mentionof any other alignment than the existing one at this moment for example in 1984 if it was 1984 oceania was atwar with eurasia and in alliance with eastasia in no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the threepowers had at any time been grouped along different linesactually as winston well knew it was only four years sinceoceania had been at war with eastasia and in alliance witheurasia but that was merely a piece of furtive knowledgewhich he happened to possess because his memory was notsatisfactorily under control officially the change of partners had never happened oceania was at war with eurasiatherefore oceania had always been at war with eurasia theenemy of the moment always represented absolute evil andit followed that any past or future agreement with him wasimpossiblethe frightening thing he reflected for the ten thousandth time as he forced his shoulders painfully backwardwith hands on hips they were gyrating their bodies fromthe waist an exercise that was supposed to be good for theback muscles—the frightening thing was that it might allbe true if the party could thrust its hand into the past andsay of this or that event it never happened—thatfree ebooks at planet ebookcom43surely was more terrifying than mere torture and deaththe party said that oceania had never been in alliancewith eurasia he winston smith knew that oceania hadbeen in alliance with eurasia as short a time as four yearsago but where did that knowledge exist only in his ownconsciousness which in any case must soon be annihilatedand if all others accepted the lie which the party imposed—if all records told the same tale—then the lie passed intohistory and became truth who controls the past ran theparty slogan controls the future who controls the presentcontrols the past and yet the past though of its nature alterable never had been altered whatever was true now wastrue from everlasting to everlasting it was quite simple allthat was needed was an unending series of victories overyour own memory reality control they called it in newspeak doublethinkstand easy barked the instructress a little more geniallywinston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilledhis lungs with air his mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink to know and not to know tobe conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies to hold simultaneously two opinionswhich cancelled out knowing them to be contradictoryand believing in both of them to use logic against logicto repudiate morality while laying claim to it to believethat democracy was impossible and that the party was theguardian of democracy to forget whatever it was necessaryto forget then to draw it back into memory again at the441984moment when it was needed and then promptly to forgetit again and above all to apply the same process to the process itself that was the ultimate subtlety consciously toinduce unconsciousness and then once again to becomeunconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performedeven to understand the word doublethink involved theuse of doublethinkthe instructress had called them to attention again andnow lets see which of us can touch our toes she said enthusiastically right over from the hips please comradesonetwo onetwowinston loathed this exercise which sent shooting painsall the way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended bybringing on another coughing fit the halfpleasant quality went out of his meditations the past he reflected hadnot merely been altered it had been actually destroyed forhow could you establish even the most obvious fact whenthere existed no record outside your own memory he triedto remember in what year he had first heard mention ofbig brother he thought it must have been at some time inthe sixties but it was impossible to be certain in the partyhistories of course big brother figured as the leader andguardian of the revolution since its very earliest days hisexploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time untilalready they extended into the fabulous world of the fortiesand the thirties when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of london in greatgleaming motorcars or horse carriages with glass sidesthere was no knowing how much of this legend was truefree ebooks at planet ebookcom45and how much invented winston could not even remember at what date the party itself had come into existence hedid not believe he had ever heard the word ingsoc before1960 but it was possible that in its oldspeak form—english socialism that is to say—it had been current earliereverything melted into mist sometimes indeed you couldput your finger on a definite lie it was not true for exampleas was claimed in the party history books that the partyhad invented aeroplanes he remembered aeroplanes sincehis earliest childhood but you could prove nothing therewas never any evidence just once in his whole life he hadheld in his hands unmistakable

first time in several yearsfree ebooks at planet ebookcom47chapter 4with the deep unconscious sigh which not even thenearness of the telescreen could prevent him fromuttering when his days work started winston pulled thespeakwrite towards him blew the dust from its mouthpieceand put on his spectacles then he unrolled and clippedtogether four small cylinders of paper which had alreadyflopped out of the pneumatic tube on the righthand sideof his deskin the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices tothe right of the speakwrite a small pneumatic tube for written messages to the left a larger one for newspapers and inthe side wall within easy reach of winstons arm a largeoblong slit protected by a wire grating this last was for thedisposal of waste paper similar slits existed in thousands ortens of thousands throughout the building not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor for somereason they were nicknamed memory holes when oneknew that any document was due for destruction or evenwhen one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about it was anautomatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory holeand drop it in whereupon it would be whirled away on acurrent of warm air to the enormous furnaces which werehidden somewhere in the recesses of the buildingwinston examined the four slips of paper which he had481984unrolled each contained a message of only one or two linesin the abbreviated jargon—not actually newspeak but consisting largely of newspeak words—which was used in theministry for internal purposes they rantimes 17384 bb speech

other three were routine matters though the second one would probably meansome tedious wading through lists of figureswinston dialled back numbers on the telescreen andcalled for the appropriate issues of the times which slidout of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes delaythe messages he had received referred to articles or newsitems which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter or as the official phrase had it to rectify forexample it appeared from the times of the seventeenthof march that big brother in his speech of the previousday had predicted that the south indian front would remain quiet but that a eurasian offensive would shortly befree ebooks at planet ebookcom49launched in north africa as it happened the eurasianhigher command had launched its offensive in south india and left north africa alone it was therefore necessaryto rewrite a paragraph of big brothers speech in such away as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened or again the times of the nineteenth of decemberhad published the official forecasts of the output of variousclasses of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of 1983which was also the sixth quarter of the ninth threeyearplan todays issue contained a statement of the actual output from which it appeared that the forecasts were in everyinstance grossly wrong winstons job was to rectify theoriginal figures by making them agree with the later onesas for the third message it referred to a very simple errorwhich could be set right in a couple of minutes as short atime ago as february the ministry of plenty had issued apromise a categorical pledge were the official words thatthere would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during1984 actually as winston was aware the chocolate rationwas to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the endof the present week all that was needed was to substitutefor the original promise a warning that it would probablybe necessary to reduce the ration at some time in aprilas soon as winston had dealt with each of the messageshe clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriatecopy of the times and pushed them into the pneumatictube then with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious he crumpled up the original message andany notes that he himself had made and dropped them into501984the memory hole to be devoured by the flameswhat happened in the unseen labyrinth to which thepneumatic tubes led he did not know in detail but he didknow in general terms as soon as all the corrections whichhappened to be necessary in any particular number of thetimes had been assembled and collated that number wouldbe reprinted the original copy destroyed and the correctedcopy placed on the files in its stead this process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers butto books periodicals pamphlets posters leaflets filmssoundtracks cartoons photographs—to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably holdany political or ideological significance day by day andalmost minute by minute the past was brought up to datein this way every prediction made by the party could beshown by documentary evidence to have been correct norwas any item of news or any expression of opinion whichconflicted with the needs of the moment ever allowed toremain on record all history was a palimpsest scrapedclean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary inno case would it have been possible once the deed was doneto prove that any falsification had taken place the largestsection of the records department far larger than the oneon which winston worked consisted simply of personswhose duty it was to track down and collect all copies ofbooks newspapers and other documents which had beensuperseded and were due for destruction a number of thetimes which might because of changes in political alignment or mistaken prophecies uttered by big brother havefree ebooks at planet ebookcom51been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearingits original date and no other copy existed to contradict itbooks also were recalled and rewritten again and againand were invariably reissued without any admission thatany alteration had been made even the written instructions which winston received and which he invariably gotrid of as soon as he had dealt with them never stated orimplied that an act of forgery was to be committed alwaysthe reference was to slips errors misprints or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests ofaccuracybut actually he thought as he readjusted the ministryof plentys figures it was not even forgery it was merely thesubstitution of one piece of nonsense for another most ofthe material that you were dealing with had no connexionwith anything in the real world not even the kind of connexion that is contained in a direct lie statistics were justas much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version a great deal of the time you were expected tomake them up out of your head for example the ministry of plentys forecast had estimated the output of bootsfor the quarter at 145 million pairs the actual output wasgiven as sixtytwo millions winston however in rewritingthe forecast marked the figure down to fiftyseven millionsso as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had beenoverfulfilled in any case sixtytwo millions was no nearer the truth than fiftyseven millions or than 145 millionsvery likely no boots had been produced at all likelier stillnobody knew how many had been produced much less521984cared all one knew was that every quarter astronomicalnumbers of boots were produced on paper while perhapshalf the population of oceania went barefoot and so it waswith every class of recorded fact great or small everythingfaded away into a shadowworld in which finally even thedate of the year had become uncertainwinston glanced across the hall in the correspondingcubicle on the other side a small preciselooking darkchinned man named tillotson was working steadily awaywith a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth veryclose to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite he had the air oftrying to keep what he was saying a secret between himselfand the telescreen he looked up and his spectacles darteda hostile flash in winstons directionwinston hardly knew tillotson and had no idea whatwork he was employed on people in the records department did not readily talk about their jobs in the longwindowless hall with its double row of cubicles and its endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring intospeakwrites there were quite a dozen people whom winston did not even know by name though he daily saw themhurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in thetwo minutes hate he knew that in the cubicle next to himthe little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out simply at tracking down and deleting from the press the namesof people who had been vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed there was a certain fitness inthis since her own husband had been vaporized a coupleof years earlier and a few cubicles away a mild ineffecfree ebooks at planet ebookcom53tual dreamy creature named ampleforth with very hairyears and a surprising talent for juggling with rhymes andmetres was engaged in producing garbled versions—definitive texts they were called—of poems which had becomeideologically offensive but which for one reason or anotherwere to be retained in the anthologies and this hall withits fifty workers or thereabouts was only one subsection asingle cell as it were in the huge complexity of the recordsdepartment beyond above below were other swarmsof workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobsthere were the huge printingshops with their subeditorstheir typography experts and their elaborately equippedstudios for the faking of photographs there was the teleprogrammes section with its engineers its producers andits teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices there were the armies of reference clerks whosejob was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicalswhich were due for recall there were the vast repositorieswhere the corrected documents were stored and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were destroyed andsomewhere or other quite anonymous there were the directing brains who coordinated the whole effort and laiddown the lines of policy which made it necessary that thisfragment of the past should be preserved that one falsifiedand the other rubbed out of existenceand the records department after all was itself only asingle branch of the ministry of truth whose primary jobwas not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizensof oceania with newspapers films textbooks telescreen541984programmes plays novels—with every conceivable kind ofinformation instruction or entertainment from a statue toa slogan from a lyric poem to a biological treatise and froma childs spellingbook to a newspeak dictionary and theministry had not only to supply the multifarious needs ofthe party but also to repeat the whole operation at a lowerlevel for the benefit of the proletariat there was a wholechain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature music drama and entertainment generally herewere produced rubbishy newspapers containing almostnothing except sport crime and astrology sensationalfivecent novelettes films oozing with sex and sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanicalmeans on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator there was even a whole subsection—pornosec itwas called in newspeak—engaged in producing the lowestkind of pornography which was sent out in sealed packetsand which no party member other than those who workedon it was permitted to look atthree messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube whilewinston was working but they were simple matters andhe had disposed of them before the two minutes hate interrupted him when the hate was over he returned tohis cubicle took the newspeak dictionary from the shelfpushed the speakwrite to one side cleaned his spectaclesand settled down to his main job of the morningwinstons greatest pleasure in life was in his work mostof it was a tedious routine but included in it there were alsojobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself infree ebooks at planet ebookcom55them as in the depths of a mathematical problem—delicatepieces of forgery in which you had nothing to guide youexcept your knowledge of the principles of ingsoc and yourestimate of what the party wanted you to say winston wasgood at this kind of thing on occasion he had

a certain comrade withers aprominent member of the inner party had been singled outfor special mention and awarded a decoration the order ofconspicuous merit second classthree months later ffcc had suddenly been dissolved561984with no reasons given one could assume that withers andhis associates were now in disgrace but there had been noreport of the matter in the press or on the telescreen thatwas to be expected since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced the greatpurges involving thousands of people with public trials oftraitors and thoughtcriminals who made abject confessionof their crimes and were afterwards executed were specialshowpieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple ofyears more commonly people who had incurred the displeasure of the party simply disappeared and were neverheard of again one never had the smallest clue as to whathad happened to them in some cases they might not evenbe dead perhaps thirty people personally known to winston not counting his parents had disappeared at one timeor anotherwinston stroked his nose gently with a paperclip in thecubicle across the way comrade tillotson was still crouching secretively over his speakwrite he raised his head fora moment again the hostile spectacleflash winston wondered whether comrade tillotson was engaged on the samejob as himself it was perfectly possible so tricky a piece ofwork would never be entrusted to a single person on theother hand to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place verylikely as many as a dozen people were now working awayon rival versions of what big brother had actually said andpresently some master brain in the inner party would select this version or that would reedit it and set in motionfree ebooks at planet ebookcom57the complex processes of crossreferencing that would berequired and then the chosen lie would pass into the permanent records and become truthwinston did not know why withers had been disgracedperhaps it was for corruption or incompetence perhaps bigbrother was merely getting rid of a toopopular subordinate perhaps withers or someone close to him had beensuspected of heretical tendencies or perhaps—what waslikeliest of all—the thing had simply happened becausepurges and vaporizations were a necessary part of the mechanics of government the only real clue lay in the wordsrefs unpersons which indicated that withers was alreadydead you could not invariably assume this to be the casewhen people were arrested sometimes they were releasedand allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year ortwo years before being executed very occasionally someperson whom you had believed dead long since would makea ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he wouldimplicate hundreds of others by his testimony before vanishing this time for ever withers however was already anunperson he did not exist he had never existed winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reversethe tendency of big brothers speech it was better to makeit deal with something totally unconnected with its original subjecthe might turn the speech into the usual denunciation oftraitors and thoughtcriminals but that was a little too obvious while to invent a victory at the front or some triumphof overproduction in the ninth threeyear plan might581984complicate the records too much what was needed was apiece of pure fantasy suddenly there sprang into his mindready made as it were the image of a certain comrade ogilvy who had recently died in battle in heroic circumstancesthere were occasions when big brother devoted his orderfor the day to commemorating some humble rankandfileparty member whose life and death he held up as an example worthy to be followed today he should commemoratecomrade ogilvy it was true that there was no such personas comrade ogilvy but a few lines of print and a couple offaked photographs

instance if you have a word likegood what need is there for a word like bad ungoodwill do just as well—better because its an exact oppositewhich the other is not or again if you want a stronger version of good what sense is there in having a whole stringof vague useless words like excellent and splendid and allthe rest of them plusgood covers the meaning or doubleplusgood if you want something stronger still of coursewe use those forms already but in the final version of newspeak therell be nothing else in the end the whole notionof goodness and badness will be covered by only six

newspeak is ingsoc andingsoc is newspeak he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction has it ever occurred to you winston that by theyear 2050 at the very latest not a single human being willbe alive

orthodoxy meansnot thinking—not needing to think orthodoxy is unconsciousnessone of these days thought winston with sudden deepconviction syme will be vaporized he is too intelligent hesees too clearly and speaks too plainly the party does notlike such people one day he will disappear it is written inhis facewinston had finished his bread and cheese he turneda little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee atthe table on his left the man with the strident voice wasstill talking remorselessly away a young woman who wasperhaps his secretary and who was sitting with her backto winston was listening to him and seemed to be eagerlyagreeing with everything that he said from time to timewinston caught some such remark as i think youre so right681984i do so agree with you uttered in a youthful and rather sillyfeminine voice but the other voice never stopped for an instant even when the girl was speaking winston knew theman by sight though he knew no more about him than thathe held some important post in the fiction department hewas a man of about thirty with a muscular throat and alarge mobile mouth his head was thrown back a little andbecause of the angle at which he was sitting his spectaclescaught the light and presented to winston two blank discsinstead of eyes what was slightly horrible was that fromthe stream of sound that poured out of his mouth it wasalmost impossible to distinguish a single word just oncewinston caught a phrase—complete and final eliminationof goldsteinism—jerked out very rapidly and as it seemedall in one piece like a line of type cast solid for the rest itwas just a noise a quackquackquacking and yet thoughyou could not actually hear what the man was saying youcould not be in any doubt about its general nature he mightbe denouncing goldstein and demanding sterner measuresagainst thoughtcriminals and saboteurs he might be fulminating against the atrocities of the eurasian army hemight be praising big brother or the heroes on the malabarfront—it made no difference whatever it was you couldbe certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy pureingsoc as he watched the eyeless face with the jaw movingrapidly up and down winston had a curious feeling thatthis was not a real human being but some kind of dummy itwas not the mans brain that was speaking it was his larynxthe stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words butfree ebooks at planet ebookcom69it was not speech in the true sense it was a noise uttered inunconsciousness like the quacking of a ducksyme had fallen silent for a moment and with the handle of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle of stewthe voice from the other table quacked rapidly on easilyaudible in spite of the surrounding dinthere is a word in newspeak said syme i dont knowwhether you know it duckspeak to quack like a duck itis one of those interesting words that have two contradictory meanings applied to an opponent it is abuse appliedto someone you agree with it is praiseunquestionably syme will be vaporized winstonthought again he thought it with a kind of sadness although well knowing that syme despised him and slightlydisliked him and was fully capable of denouncing him asa thoughtcriminal if he saw any reason for doing so therewas something subtly wrong with syme there was something that he lacked discretion aloofness a sort of savingstupidity you could not say that he was unorthodox he believed in the principles of ingsoc he venerated big brotherhe rejoiced over victories he hated heretics not merely withsincerity but with a sort of restless zeal an uptodatenessof information which the ordinary party member did notapproach yet a faint air of disreputability always clung tohim he said things that would have been better unsaid hehad read too many books he frequented the chestnut treecafe haunt of painters and musicians there was no lawnot even an unwritten law against frequenting the chestnut tree cafe yet the place was somehow illomened the701984old discredited leaders of the party had been used to gatherthere before they were finally purged goldstein himself itwas said had sometimes been seen there years and decadesago symes fate was not difficult to foresee and yet it wasa fact that if syme grasped even for three seconds the nature of his winstons secret opinions he would betray himinstantly to the thought police so would anybody else forthat matter but syme more than most zeal was not enoughorthodoxy was unconsciousnesssyme looked up here comes parsons he saidsomething in the tone of his voice seemed to add thatbloody fool parsons winstons fellowtenant at victorymansions was in fact threading his way across the room—a tubby middlesized man with fair hair and a froglike faceat thirtyfive he was already putting on rolls of fat at neckand waistline but his movements were brisk and boyishhis whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large somuch so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls it was almost impossible not to think of him as beingdressed in the blue shorts grey shirt and red neckerchiefof the spies in visualizing him one saw always a pictureof dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms parsons did indeed invariably revert to shorts whena community hike or any other physical activity gave himan excuse for doing so he greeted them both with a cheeryhullo hullo and sat down at the table giving off an intense smell of sweat beads of moisture stood out all overhis pink face his powers of sweating were extraordinaryat the community

brainy for me i expect smith old boy ill tell you why im chasing you itsthat sub you forgot to give mewhich sub is that said winston automatically feeling for money about a quarter of ones salary had to beearmarked for voluntary subscriptions which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of themfor hate week you know—the housebyhouse fundim treasurer for our block were making an allout effort—going to put on a tremendous show i tell you it wont be myfault if old victory mansions doesnt have the biggest outfitof flags in the whole street two dollars you promised mewinston

winstonah well—what i mean to say shows the right spiritdoesnt it mischievous little beggars they are both of them721984but talk about keenness all they think about is the spiesand the war of course dyou know what that little girl ofmine did last saturday when her troop was on a hike outberkhamsted way she got two other girls to go with herslipped off from the hike and spent the whole afternoonfollowing a strange man they kept on his tail for two hoursright through the woods and then when they got into amersham handed him over to the patrolswhat did they do that for said winston somewhat taken aback parsons went on triumphantlymy kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent—might have been dropped by parachute for instance butheres the point old boy what do you think put her on tohim in the first place she spotted he was wearing a funnykind of shoes—said shed never seen anyone wearing shoeslike that before so the chances were he was a foreignerpretty smart for a nipper of seven ehwhat happened to the man said winstonah that i couldnt say of course but i wouldnt be altogether surprised if—— parsons made the motion of aiminga rifle and clicked his tongue for the explosiongood said syme abstractedly without looking up fromhis strip of paperof course we cant afford to take chances agreed winston dutifullywhat i mean to say there is a war on said parsonsas though in confirmation of this a trumpet call floated from the telescreen just above their heads however itwas not the proclamation of a military victory this time butfree ebooks at planet

completed of the outputof all classes of consumption goods show that the standardof living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the pastyear all over oceania this morning there were irrepressiblespontaneous demonstrations when workers marched out offactories and offices and paraded through the streets withbanners voicing their gratitude to big brother for the newhappy life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon ushere are some of the completed figures foodstuffs——the phrase our new happy life recurred several times ithad been a favourite of late with the ministry of plenty parsons his attention caught by the trumpet call sat listeningwith a sort of gaping solemnity a sort of edified boredomhe could not follow the figures but he was aware that theywere in some way a cause for satisfaction he had lugged outa huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charredtobacco with the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week itwas seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top winston wassmoking a victory cigarette which he held carefully horizontal the new ration did not start till tomorrow and hehad only four cigarettes left for the moment he had shut hisears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff thatstreamed out of the telescreen it appeared that there hadeven been demonstrations to thank big brother for raisingthe chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week and onlyyesterday he reflected it had been announced that the ra741984tion was to be reduced to twenty grammes a week was itpossible that they could swallow that after only twentyfourhours yes they swallowed it parsons swallowed it easilywith the stupidity of an animal the eyeless creature at theother table swallowed it fanatically passionately with a furious desire to track down denounce and vaporize anyonewho should suggest that last week the ration had been thirtygrammes syme too—in some more complex way involving doublethink syme swallowed it was he then alonein the possession of a memorythe fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen as compared with last year there was more foodmore clothes more houses more furniture more cookingpots more fuel more ships more helicopters morebooks more babies—more of everything except diseasecrime and insanity year by year and minute by minuteeverybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwardsas syme had done earlier winston had taken up his spoonand was dabbling in the palecoloured gravy that dribbledacross the table drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern he meditated resentfully on the physical texture oflife had it always been like this had food always tastedlike this he looked round the canteen a lowceilingedcrowded room its walls grimy from the contact of innumerable bodies

round the canteen again nearly everyone wasugly and would still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue overalls on the far side of theroom sitting at a table alone a small curiously beetlelikeman was drinking a cup of coffee his little eyes darting suspicious glances from side to side how easy it was thoughtwinston if you did not look about you to believe that thephysical type set up by the party as an ideal—tall muscular youths and deepbosomed maidens blondhaired vitalsunburnt carefree—existed and even predominated ac761984tually so far as he could judge the majority of people inairstrip one were small dark and illfavoured it was curious how that beetlelike type proliferated in the ministrieslittle dumpy men growing stout very early in life withshort legs swift scuttling movements and fat inscrutablefaces with very small eyes it was the type that seemed toflourish best under the dominion of the partythe announcement from the ministry of plenty endedon another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music parsons stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment offigures took his pipe out of his mouththe ministry of plentys certainly done a good job thisyear he said with a knowing shake of his head by the waysmith old boy i suppose you havent got any razor bladesyou can let me havenot one said winston ive been using the same bladefor six weeks myselfah well—just thought id ask you old boysorry said winstonthe quacking voice from the next table temporarily silenced during the ministrys announcement had started upagain as loud as ever for some reason winston suddenlyfound himself thinking of mrs parsons with her wispy hairand the dust in the creases of her face within two yearsthose children would be denouncing her to the thoughtpolice mrs parsons would be vaporized syme would bevaporized winston would be vaporized obrien wouldbe vaporized parsons on the other hand would never bevaporized the eyeless creature with the

and the girlwith dark hair the girl from the fiction department—shewould never be vaporized either it seemed to him that heknew instinctively who would survive and who would perish though just what it was that made for survival it wasnot easy to sayat this moment he was dragged out of his reverie witha violent jerk the girl at the next table had turned partlyround and was looking at him it was the girl with dark hairshe was looking at him in a sidelong way but with curiousintensity the instant she caught his eye she looked awayagainthe sweat started out on winstons backbone a horrible pang of terror went through him it was gone almost atonce but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind whywas she watching him why did she keep following himabout unfortunately he could not remember whether shehad already been at the table when he arrived or had comethere afterwards but yesterday at any rate during the twominutes hate she had sat immediately behind him whenthere was no apparent need to do so quite likely her realobject had been to listen to him and make sure whether hewas shouting loudly enoughhis earlier thought returned to him probably she wasnot actually a member of the thought police but then itwas precisely the amateur spy who was the greatest dangerof all he did not know how long she had been looking at781984him but perhaps for as much as five minutes and it waspossible that his features had not been perfectly under control it was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wanderwhen you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen the smallest thing could give you away a nervoustic an unconscious look of anxiety a habit of muttering toyourself—anything that carried with it the suggestion ofabnormality of having something to hide in any case towear an improper expression on your face to look incredulous when a victory was announced for example was itselfa punishable offence there was even a word for it in newspeak facecrime it was calledthe girl had turned her back on him again perhaps afterall she was not really following him about perhaps it wascoincidence that she had sat so close to him two days running his cigarette had gone out and he laid it carefully onthe edge of the table he would finish smoking it after workif he could keep the tobacco in it quite likely the personat the next table was a spy of the thought police and quitelikely he would be in the cellars of the ministry of lovewithin three days but a cigarette end must not be wastedsyme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away inhis pocket parsons had begun talking againdid i ever tell you old boy he said chuckling round thestem of his pipe about the time when those two nippersof mine set fire to the old marketwomans skirt becausethey

gives em the right idea ehat this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistleit was the signal to return to work all three men sprang totheir feet to join in the struggle round the lifts and the remaining tobacco fell out of winstons cigarette801984chapter 6winston was writing in his diaryit was three years ago it was on a dark evening in anarrow sidestreet near one of the big railway stations shewas standing near a doorway in the wall under a street lampthat hardly gave any light she had a young face paintedvery thick it was really the paint that appealed to me thewhiteness of it like a mask and the bright red lips partywomen never paint their faces there was nobody else in thestreet and no telescreens she said two dollars i——for the moment it was too difficult to go on he shut hiseyes and pressed his fingers against them trying to squeezeout the vision that kept recurring he had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at thetop of his voice or to bang his head against the wall to kickover the table and hurl the inkpot through the window—todo any violent or noisy or painful thing that might blackout the memory that was tormenting himyour worst enemy he reflected was your own nervoussystem at any moment the tension inside you was liable totranslate itself into some visible symptom he thought ofa man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks backa quite ordinarylooking man a party member aged thirfree ebooks at planet ebookcom81tyfive to forty tallish and thin carrying a briefcase theywere a few metres apart when the left side of the mans facewas suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm it happenedagain just as they were passing one another it was only atwitch a quiver rapid as the clicking of a camera shutterbut obviously habitual he remembered thinking at thetime that poor devil is done for and what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly unconscious themost deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep therewas no way of guarding against that so far as he could seehe drew his breath and went on writingi went with her through the doorway and across a backyardinto a basement kitchen there was a bed against the walland a lamp on the table turned down very low she——his teeth were set on edge he would have liked to spitsimultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchenhe thought of katharine his wife winston was married—had been married at any rate probably he still was marriedso far as he knew his wife was not dead he seemed tobreathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes andvillainous cheap scent but nevertheless alluring becauseno woman of the party ever used scent or could be imagined as doing so only the proles used scent in his mind thesmell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornicationwhen he had gone with that woman it had been his firstlapse in two years or thereabouts consorting with prosti821984tutes was forbidden of course but it was one of those rulesthat you could occasionally nerve yourself to break it wasdangerous but it was not a lifeanddeath matter to becaught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forcedlabour camp not more if you had committed no otheroffence and it was easy enough provided that you couldavoid being caught in the act the poorer quarters swarmedwith women who were ready to sell themselves some couldeven be purchased for a bottle of gin which the proles werenot supposed to drink tacitly the party was even inclinedto encourage prostitution as an outlet for instincts whichcould not be altogether suppressed mere debauchery didnot matter very much so long as it was furtive and joylessand only involved the women of a submerged and despisedclass the unforgivable crime was promiscuity betweenparty members but—though this was one of the crimesthat the accused in the great purges invariably confessedto—it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happeningthe aim of the party was not merely to prevent men andwomen from forming loyalties which it might not be ableto control its real undeclared purpose was to remove allpleasure from the sexual act not love so much as eroticism was the enemy inside marriage as well as outside itall marriages between party members had to be approvedby a committee appointed for the purpose and—thoughthe principle was never clearly stated—permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impressionof being physically attracted to one another the only recfree ebooks at planet ebookcom83ognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for theservice of the party sexual intercourse was to be looked onas a slightly disgusting minor operation like having an enema this again was never put into plain words but in anindirect way it was rubbed into every party member fromchildhood onwards there were even organizations suchas the junior antisex league which advocated completecelibacy for both sexes all children were to be begottenby artificial insemination artsem it was called in newspeak and brought up in public institutions this winstonwas aware was not meant altogether seriously but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the party theparty was trying to kill the sex instinct or if it could not bekilled then to distort it and dirty it he did not know whythis was so but it seemed natural that it should be so andas far as the women were concerned the partys efforts werelargely successfulhe thought again of katharine it must be nine ten—nearly eleven years since they had parted it was curioushow seldom he thought of her for days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married they hadonly been together for about fifteen months the party didnot permit divorce but it rather encouraged separation incases where there were no childrenkatharine was a tall fairhaired girl very straight withsplendid movements she had a bold aquiline face a facethat one might have called noble until one discovered thatthere was as nearly as possible nothing behind it very earlyin her married life he had decided—though perhaps it was841984only that he knew her more intimately than he knew mostpeople—that she had without exception the most stupidvulgar empty mind that he had ever encountered she hadnot a thought in her head that was not a slogan and therewas no imbecility absolutely none that she was not capableof swallowing if the party handed it out to her the human soundtrack he nicknamed her in his own mind yethe could have endured living with her if it had not been forjust one thing—sexas soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen to embrace her was like embracing a jointed woodenimage and what was strange was that even when she wasclasping him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength therigidlty of her muscles managed to convey that impression she would lie there with shut eyes neither resistingnor cooperating but submitting it was extraordinarily embarrassing and after a while horrible but even thenhe could have borne living with her if it had been agreedthat they should remain celibate but curiously enough itwas katharine who refused this they must she said produce a child if they could so the performance continued tohappen once a week quite regulariy whenever it was notimpossible she even used to remind him of it in the morning as something which had to be done that evening andwhich must not be forgotten she had two names for it onewas making a baby and the other was our duty to the party yes she had actually used that phrase quite soon hegrew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointedfree ebooks at planet ebookcom85day came round but luckily no child appeared and in theend she agreed to give up trying and soon afterwards theypartedwinston sighed inaudibly he picked up his pen againand wroteshe threw herself down on the bed and at once without anykind of preliminary in the most coarse horrible way you canimagine pulled up her skirt i——he saw himself standing there in the dim lamplightwith the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils andin his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which evenat that moment was mixed up with the thought of katharines white body frozen for ever by the hypnotic powerof the party why did it always have to be like this whycould he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthyscuffles at intervals of years but a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event the women of the party were allalike chastity was as deep ingrained in them as party loyalty by careful early conditioning by games and cold waterby the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and inthe spies and the youth league by lectures parades songsslogans and martial music the natural feeling had beendriven out of them his reason told him that there must beexceptions but his heart did not believe it they were all impregnable as the party intended that they should be andwhat he wanted more even than to be loved was to breakdown that wall of virtue even if it were only once in his861984whole life the sexual act successfully performed was rebellion desire was thoughtcrime even to have awakenedkatharine if he could have achieved it would have beenlike a seduction although she was his wifebut the rest of the story had got to be written down hewrotei turned up the lamp when i saw her in the light——after the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamphad seemed very bright for the first time he could see thewoman properly he had taken a step towards her and thenhalted full of lust and terror he was painfully conscious ofthe risk he had taken in coming here it was perfectly possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out forthat matter they might be waiting outside the door at thismoment if he went away without even doing what he hadcome here to do——it had got to be written down it had got to be confessedwhat he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that thewoman was old the paint was plastered so thick on herface that it looked as though it might crack like a cardboardmask there were streaks of white in her hair but the trulydreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little openrevealing nothing except a cavernous blackness she had noteeth at allhe wrote hurriedly in scrabbling handwritingwhen i saw her in the light she was quite an old woman fiftyfree ebooks at planet ebookcom87years old at least but i went ahead and did it just the samehe pressed his fingers against his eyelids again he hadwritten it down at last but it made no difference the therapy had not worked the urge to shout filthy words at the topof his voice was as strong as ever881984chapter 7if there is hope wrote winston it lies in the prolesif there was hope it must lie in the proles becauseonly there in those swarming disregarded masses 85 percent of the population of oceania could the force to destroy the party ever be generated the party could not beoverthrown from within its enemies if it had any

sooner or later it must occur to them to doit and yet——he remembered how once he had been walking downa crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds ofvoices womens voices—had burst from a sidestreet a littleway ahead it was a great formidable cry of anger and despair a deep loud ohooooh that went humming onlike the reverberation of a bell his heart had leapt its startfree ebooks at planet ebookcom89ed he had thought a riot the proles are breaking looseat last when he had reached the spot it was to see a mobof two or three hundred women crowding round the stallsof a street market with faces as tragic as though they hadbeen the doomed passengers on a sinking ship but at thismoment the general despair broke down into a multitudeof individual quarrels it appeared that one of the stallshad been selling tin saucepans they were wretched flimsythings but cookingpots of any kind were always difficultto get now the supply had unexpectedly given out thesuccessful women bumped and jostled by the rest weretrying to make off with their saucepans while dozens ofothers clamoured round the stall accusing the stallkeeperof favouritism and of having more saucepans somewherein reserve there was a fresh outburst of yells two bloated women one of them with her hair coming down hadgot hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear itout of one anothers hands for a moment they were bothtugging and then the handle came off winston watchedthem disgustedly and yet just for a moment what almostfrightening power had sounded in that cry from only a fewhundred throats why was it that they could never shoutlike that about anything that matteredhe wroteuntil they become conscious they will never rebel and untilafter they have rebelled they can not become consciousthat he reflected

by thecapitalists they had been starved and flogged women hadbeen forced to work in the coal mines women still did workin the coal mines as a matter of fact children had beensold into the factories at the age of six but simultaneously true to the principles of doublethink the party taughtthat the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept insubjection like animals by the application of a few

ofsteel and concrete of monstrous machines and terrifyingweapons—a nation of warriors and fanatics marching forward in perfect unity all thinking the same thoughts andshouting the same slogans perpetually working fightingtriumphing persecuting—three hundred million people allwith the same face the reality was decaying dingy cities941984where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky

with statisticsproving that people today had more food more clothesbetter houses better recreations—that they lived longerworked shorter hours were bigger healthier stronger happier more intelligent better educated than the people offifty years ago not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved the party claimed for example that today 40 percent of adult proles were literate before the revolution itwas said the number had only been 15 per cent the partyclaimed that the infant mortality rate was now only 160 perthousand whereas before the revolution it had been 300—and so it went on it was like a single equation with twounknowns it might very well be that literally every word inthe history books even the things that one accepted without question was pure fantasy for all he knew there mightnever have been any such law as the jus primae noctisor any such creature as a capitalist or any such garment asa top hateverything faded into mist the past was erased the erasure was

had held it between his fingers for as long asthirty seconds in 1973 it must have been—at any rate itwas at about the time when he and katharine had partedbut the really relevant date was seven or eight years earlierthe story really began in the middle sixties the period ofthe great purges in which the original leaders of the revolution were wiped out once and for all by 1970 none of themwas left except big brother himself all the rest had by thattime been exposed as traitors and counterrevolutionaries goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew whereand of the others a few had simply disappeared while themajority had been executed after spectacular public trialsat which they made confession of their crimes among thelast survivors were three men named jones aaronson andrutherford it must have been in 1965 that these three hadbeen arrested as often happened they had vanished for ayear or more so that one did not know whether they werealive or dead and then had suddenly been brought forthto incriminate themselves in the usual way they had confessed to intelligence with the enemy at that date too theenemy was eurasia embezzlement of public funds themurder of various trusted party members intrigues againstthe leadership of big brother which had started long beforethe revolution happened and acts of sabotage causing thedeath of hundreds of thousands of people after confessing to these things they had been pardoned reinstated inthe party and given posts which were in fact sinecures butwhich sounded important all three had written long ab961984ject articles in the times analysing the reasons for theirdefection and promising to make amendssome time after their release winston had actually seenall three of them in the chestnut tree cafe he rememberedthe sort of terrified fascination with which he had watchedthem out of the corner of his eye they were men far older than himself relics of the ancient world almost the lastgreat figures left over from the heroic days of the party theglamour of the underground struggle and the civil war stillfaintly clung to them he had the feeling though already atthat time facts and dates were growing blurry that he hadknown their names years earlier than he had known that ofbig brother but also they were outlaws enemies untouchables doomed with absolute certainty to extinction withina year or two no one who had once fallen into the handsof the thought police ever escaped in the end they werecorpses waiting to be sent back to the gravethere was no one at any of the tables nearest to them itwas not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood of suchpeople they were sitting in silence before glasses of the ginflavoured with cloves which was the speciality of the cafeof the three it was rutherford whose appearance had mostimpressed winston rutherford had once been a famouscaricaturist whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflamepopular opinion before and during the revolution evennow at long intervals his cartoons were appearing in thetimes they were simply an imitation of his earlier mannerand curiously lifeless and unconvincing always they werea rehashing of the ancient themes—slum tenements starvfree ebooks at planet ebookcom97ing children street battles capitalists in top hats—even onthe barricades the capitalists still seemed to cling to theirtop hats an endless hopeless effort to get back into the pasthe was a monstrous man with a mane of greasy grey hairhis face pouched and seamed with thick negroid lips atone time he must have been immensely strong now hisgreat body was sagging sloping bulging falling away inevery direction he seemed to be breaking up before oneseyes like a mountain crumblingit was the lonely hour of fifteen winston could notnow remember how he had come to be in the cafe at sucha time the place was almost empty a tinny music wastrickling from the telescreens the three men sat in theircorner almost motionless never speaking uncommandedthe waiter brought fresh glasses of gin there was a chessboard on the table beside them with the pieces set out butno game started and then for perhaps half a minute in allsomething happened to the telescreens the tune that theywere playing changed and the tone of the music changedtoo there came into it—but it was something hard to describe it was a peculiar cracked braying jeering note inhis mind winston called it a yellow note and then a voicefrom the telescreen was singingunder the spreading chestnut treei sold you and you sold methere lie they and here lie weunder the spreading chestnut tree981984the three men never stirred but when winston glancedagain at rutherfords ruinous face he saw that his eyeswere full of tears and for the first time he noticed with akind of inward shudder and yet not knowing at whathe shuddered that both aaronson and rutherford had broken nosesa little later all three were rearrested it appeared thatthey had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release at their second trial they confessed toall their old crimes over again with a whole string of newones they were executed and their fate was recorded inthe party histories a warning to posterity about five yearsafter this in 1973 winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube onto his desk when he came on a fragment of paper whichhad evidently been slipped in among the others and thenforgotten the instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance it was a halfpage torn out of the times of aboutten years earlier—the top half of the page so that it includedthe date—and it contained a photograph of the delegates atsome party function in new york prominent in the middleof the group were jones aaronson and rutherford therewas no mistaking them in any case their names were in thecaption at the bottomthe point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that date they had been on eurasian soil theyhad flown from a secret airfield in canada to a rendezvoussomewhere in siberia and had conferred with members ofthe eurasian general staff to whom they had betrayed imfree ebooks at planet ebookcom99portant military secrets the date had stuck in winstonsmemory because it chanced to be midsummer day but thewhole story must be on record in countless other places aswell there was only one possible conclusion the confessions were liesof course this was not in itself a discovery even at thattime winston had not imagined that the people who werewiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimesthat they were accused of but this was concrete evidenceit was a fragment of the abolished past like a fossil bonewhich turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory it was enough to blow the party to atoms ifin some way it could have been published to the world andits significance made knownhe had gone straight on working as soon as he saw whatthe photograph was and what it meant he had covered itup with another sheet of paper luckily when he unrolledit it had been upsidedown from the point of view of thetelescreenhe took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed backhis chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible to keep your face expressionless was not difficult andeven your breathing could be controlled with an effortbut you could not control the beating of your heart andthe telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up helet what he judged to be ten minutes go by tormented allthe while by the fear that some accident—a sudden draughtblowing across his desk for instance—would betray himthen without uncovering it again he dropped the photo1001984graph into the memory hole along with some other wastepapers within another minute perhaps it would havecrumbled into ashesthat was ten—eleven years ago today probably hewould have kept that photograph it was curious that thefact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to makea difference even now when the photograph itself as wellas the event it recorded was only memory was the partyshold upon the past less strong he wondered because a pieceof evidence which existed no longer had once existedbut today supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes the photograph might not even beevidence already at the time when he made his discovery oceania was no longer at war with eurasia and it musthave been to the agents of eastasia that the three dead menhad betrayed their country since then there had been other changes—two three he could not remember how manyvery likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewrittenuntil the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest significance the past not only changed but changedcontinuously what most afflicted him with the sense ofnightmare was that he had never clearly understood whythe huge imposture was undertaken the immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious but the ultimatemotive was mysterious he took up his pen again andwrotei understand how i do not understand whyfree ebooks at planet ebookcom101he wondered as he had many times wondered beforewhether he himself was a lunatic perhaps a lunatic wassimply a minority of one at one time it had been a sign ofmadness to believe that the earth goes round the sun todayto believe that the past is inalterable he might be alonein holding that belief and if alone then a lunatic but thethought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him thehorror was that he might also be wronghe picked up the childrens history book and looked atthe portrait of big brother which formed its frontispiecethe hypnotic eyes gazed into his own it was as thoughsome huge force were pressing down upon you—somethingthat penetrated inside your skull

to believe it it was inevitable that they shouldmake that claim sooner or later the logic of their positiondemanded it not merely the validity of experience but thevery existence of external reality was tacitly denied by theirphilosophy the heresy of heresies was common sense andwhat was terrifying was not that they would kill you forthinking otherwise but that they might be right for afterall how do we know that two and two make four or thatthe force of gravity works or that the past is unchangeable if both the past and the external world exist only inthe mind and if the mind itself is controllable what thenbut no his courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of itsown accord the face of obrien not called up by any obvi1021984ous association had floated into his mind he knew withmore certainty than before that obrien was on his sidehe was writing the diary for obrien—to obrien it waslike an interminable letter which no one would ever readbut which was addressed to a particular

plus two make four ifthat is granted all else followsfree ebooks at planet ebookcom103chapter 8from somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell ofroasting coffee—real coffee not victory coffee—camefloating out into the street winston paused involuntarilyfor perhaps two seconds he was back in the halfforgottenworld of his childhood then a door banged seeming to cutoff the smell as abruptly as though it had been a soundhe had walked several kilometres over pavements andhis varicose ulcer was throbbing this was the second timein three weeks that he had missed an evening at the community centre a rash act since you could be certain thatthe number of your attendances at the centre was carefully checked in principle a party member had no sparetime and was never alone except in bed it was assumedthat when he was not working eating or sleeping he wouldbe taking part in some kind of communal recreation to doanything that suggested a taste for solitude even to go for awalk by yourself was always slightly dangerous there wasa word for it in newspeak ownlife it was called meaning individualism and eccentricity but this evening as hecame out of the ministry the balminess of the april air hadtempted him the sky was a warmer blue than he had seen itthat year and suddenly the long noisy evening at the centre the boring exhausting games the lectures the creakingcamaraderie oiled by gin had seemed intolerable on im1041984pulse he had turned away from the busstop and wanderedoff into the labyrinth of london first south then east thennorth again losing himself among unknown streets andhardly bothering in which direction he was goingif there is hope he had written in the diary it lies inthe proles the words kept coming back to him statementof a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity he was somewhere in the vague browncoloured slums to the north andeast of what had once been saint pancras station he waswalking up a cobbled street of little twostorey houses withbattered doorways which gave straight on the pavementand which were somehow curiously suggestive of ratholesthere were puddles of filthy water here and there among thecobbles in and out of the dark doorways and down narrowalleyways that branched off on either side people swarmedin astonishing numbers—girls in full bloom with crudely lipsticked mouths and youths who chased the girls andswollen waddling women who showed you what the girlswould be like in ten years time and old bent creatures shuffling along on splayed feet and ragged barefooted childrenwho played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yellsfrom their mothers perhaps a quarter of the windows inthe street were broken and boarded up most of the peoplepaid no attention to winston a few eyed him with a sort ofguarded curiosity two monstrous women with brickredforearms folded across thelr aprons were talking outside adoorway winston caught scraps of conversation as he approachedyes i says to er thats all very well i says but if youdfree ebooks at planet ebookcom105of been in my place youd of done the same as what i doneits easy to criticize i says but you aint got the same problems as what i gotah said the other thats jest it thats jest where it isthe strident voices stopped abruptly the women studied him in hostile silence as he went past but it was nothostility exactly merely a kind of wariness a momentarystiffening as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal theblue overalls of the party could not be a common sight ina street like this indeed it was unwise to be seen in suchplaces unless you had definite business there the patrolsmight stop you if you happened to run into them may i seeyour papers comrade what are you doing here what timedid you leave work is this your usual way home—and soon and so forth not that there was any rule against walkinghome by an unusual route but it was enough to draw attention to you if the thought police heard about itsuddenly the whole street was in commotion therewere yells of warning from all sides people were shootinginto the doorways like rabbits a young woman leapt outof a doorway a little ahead of winston grabbed up a tinychild playing in a puddle whipped her apron round it andleapt back again all in one movement at the same instant aman in a concertinalike black suit who had emerged froma side alley ran towards winston pointing excitedly to theskysteamer he yelled look out guvnor bang overeadlay down quicksteamer was a nickname which for some reason the1061984proles applied to rocket bombs winston promptly flunghimself on his face the proles were nearly always rightwhen they gave you a warning of this kind they seemedto possess some kind of instinct which told them severalseconds in advance when a rocket was coming althoughthe rockets supposedly travelled faster than sound winston clasped his forearms above his head there was a roarthat seemed to make the pavement heave a shower of lightobjects pattered on to his back when he stood up he foundthat he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest windowhe walked on the bomb had demolished a group ofhouses 200 metres up the street a black plume of smokehung in the sky and below it a cloud of plaster dust in whicha crowd was already forming around the ruins there was alittle pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him andin the middle of it he could see a bright red streak when hegot up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at thewrist apart from the bloody stump the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster casthe kicked the thing into the gutter and then to avoidthe crowd turned down a sidestreet to the right within three or four minutes he was out of the area which thebomb had affected and the sordid swarming life of thestreets was going on as though nothing had happened itwas nearly twenty hours and the drinkingshops which theproles frequented pubs they called them were chokedwith customers from their grimy swing doors endlesslyopening and shutting there came forth a smell of urinefree ebooks at planet ebookcom107sawdust and sour beer in an angle formed by a projectinghousefront three men were standing very close together the middle one of them holding a foldedup newspaperwhich the other two were studying over his shoulder evenbefore he was near enough to make out the expression ontheir faces winston could see absorption in every line oftheir bodies it was obviously some serious piece of newsthat they were reading he was a few paces away from themwhen suddenly the group broke up and two of the men werein violent altercation for a moment they seemed almost onthe point of blowscant you bleeding well listen to what i say i tell youno number ending in

down in blackand white an i tell you no number——oh pack it in said the third manthey were talking about the lottery winston lookedback when he had gone thirty metres they were still arguing with vivid passionate faces the lottery with itsweekly payout of enormous prizes was the one public event1081984to which the proles paid serious attention it was probablethat there were some millions of proles for whom the lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remainingalive it was their delight their folly their anodyne theirintellectual stimulant where the lottery was concernedeven people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memorythere was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply byselling systems forecasts and lucky amulets winston hadnothing to do with the running of the lottery which wasmanaged by the ministry of plenty but he was aware indeed everyone in the party was aware that the prizes werelargely imaginary only small sums were actually paid outthe winners of the big prizes being nonexistent persons inthe absence of any real intercommunication between onepart of oceania and another this was not difficult to arrangebut if there was hope it lay in the proles you had to clingon to that when you put it in words it sounded reasonableit was when you looked at the human beings passing you onthe pavement that it became an act of faith the street intowhich he had turned ran downhill he had a feeling that hehad been in this neighbourhood before and that there wasa main thoroughfare not far away from somewhere aheadthere came a din of shouting voices the street took a sharpturn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down intoa sunken alley where a few stallkeepers were selling tiredlooking vegetables at this moment winston rememberedwhere he was the alley led out into the main street andfree ebooks at planet ebookcom109down the next turning not five minutes away was the junkshop where he had bought the blank book which was nowhis diary and in a small stationers shop not far away hehad bought his penholder and his bottle of inkhe paused for a moment at the top of the steps on theopposite side of the alley there was a dingy little pub whosewindows appeared to be frosted over but in reality weremerely coated with dust a very old man bent but activewith white moustaches that bristled forward like those of aprawn pushed open the swing door and went in as winston stood watching it occurred to him that the old manwho must be eighty at the least had already been middleaged when the revolution happened he and a few otherslike him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of capitalism in the party itself there were notmany people left whose ideas had been formed before therevolution the older generation had mostly been wiped outin the great purges of the fifties and sixties and the few whosurvived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual surrender if there was any one still alive who couldgive you a truthful account of conditions in the early partof the century it could only be a prole suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into his diarycame back into winstons mind and a lunatic impulse tookhold of him he would go into the pub he would scrape acquaintance with that old man and question him he wouldsay to him tell me about your life when you were a boywhat was it like in those days were things better than theyare now or were they worse1101984hurriedly lest he should have time to become frightenedhe descended the steps and crossed the narrow street itwas madness of course as usual there was no definite ruleagainst talking to proles and frequenting their pubs but itwas far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed if the patrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness but itwas not likely that they would believe him he pushed openthe door and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit him inthe face as he entered the din of voices dropped to abouthalf its volume behind his back he could feel everyone eyeing his blue overalls a game of darts which was going on atthe other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps asmuch as thirty seconds the old man whom he had followedwas standing at the bar having some kind of altercationwith the barman a large stout hooknosed young manwith enormous forearms a knot of others standing roundwith glasses in their hands were watching the scenei arst you civil enough didnt i said the old manstraightening his shoulders

uneasiness causedby winstons entry seemed to disappear the old mans whitestubbled face had flushed pink he turned away mutteringto himself and bumped into winston winston caught himgently by the

not to drink gin though inpractice they could get hold of it easily enough the game ofdarts was in full swing again and the knot of men at the barhad begun talking about lottery tickets winstons presencewas forgotten for a moment there was a deal table underthe window where he and the old man could talk withoutfear of being overheard it was horribly dangerous but atany rate there was no

satisfy and a ole litres too much it starts my bladderrunning let alone the priceyou must have seen great changes since you were a youngman said winston tentativelythe old mans pale blue eyes moved from the darts boardto the bar and from the bar to the door of the gents asthough it were in the barroom that he expected the changes to have occurredthe beer was better he said finally and cheaper wheni was a young man mild beer—wallop we used to call it—was fourpence a pint that was before the war of coursewhich war was that said winstonits all wars said the old man vaguely he took up hisglass

them hadnt even boots on their feet theyworked twelve hours a day they left school at nine theyslept ten in a room and at the same time there were a veryfew people only a few thousands—the capitalists

relevant facts were outside the range of their visionthey were like the ant which can see small objects but notlarge ones and when memory failed and written recordswere falsified—when that happened the claim of the partyto have improved the conditions of human life had got to beaccepted because there did not exist and never again couldexist any standard against which it could be testedat this moment his train of thought stopped abruptlyhe halted and looked up he was in a narrow street with afew dark little shops interspersed among dwellinghousesimmediately above his head there hung three discolouredmetal balls which looked as if they had once been gildedhe seemed to know the place of course he was standingoutside the junkshop where he had bought the diarya twinge of fear went through him it had been a sufficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning and hehad sworn never to come near the place again and yet theinstant that he allowed his thoughts to wander his feet hadbrought him back here of their own accord it was preciselyagainst suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped toguard himself by opening the diary at the same time henoticed that although it was nearly twentyone hours theshop was still open with the feeling that he would be lessconspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement1181984he stepped through the doorway if questioned he

with a long benevolent noseand mild eyes distorted by thick spectacles his hair was almost white but his eyebrows were bushy and still black hisspectacles his gentle fussy movements and the fact that

paper that was creamlaid it used to be called theres been no paper like thatmade for—oh i dare say fifty years he peered at winstonover the top of his spectacles is there anything special ican do for

interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortablyfull but there was almost nothing in it of the slightest value the floorspace was very restricted because all roundthe walls were stacked innumerable dusty pictureframesin the window there were trays of nuts and bolts wornoutchisels penknives with broken blades tarnished watchesthat did not even pretend to be in going order and othermiscellaneous rubbish only on a small table in the cornerwas there a litter of odds and ends—lacquered snuffboxes agate brooches and the like—which looked as thoughthey might include something interesting as winstonwandered towards the table his eye was caught by a roundsmooth thing that gleamed softly in the lamplight and hepicked it upit was a heavy lump of glass curved on one side flaton the other making almost a hemisphere there was apeculiar softness as of rainwater in both the colour andthe texture of the glass at the heart of it magnified by thecurved surface there was a strange pink convoluted objectthat recalled a rose or a sea anemonewhat is it said winston fascinatedthats coral that is said the old man it must have comefrom the indian ocean they used to kind of embed it inthe glass that wasnt made less than a hundred years agomore by the look of itits a beautiful thing said winstonit is a beautiful thing said the other appreciatively buttheres not many thatd say so nowadays he coughed now1201984if it so happened that you wanted to buy it thatd cost youfour dollars i can remember when a thing like that wouldhave fetched eight pounds and eight pounds was—well icant work it out but it was a lot of money but who caresabout genuine antiques nowadays—even the few thatsleftwinston immediately paid over the four dollars and slidthe coveted thing into his pocket what appealed to himabout it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed topossess of belonging to an age quite different from the present one the soft rainwatery glass was not like any glass thathe had ever seen the thing was doubly attractive becauseof its apparent uselessness though he could guess that itmust once have been intended as a paperweight it was veryheavy in his pocket but fortunately it did not make muchof a bulge it was a queer thing even a compromising thingfor a party member to have in his possession anything oldand for that matter anything beautiful was always vaguelysuspect the old man had grown noticeably more cheerfulafter receiving the four dollars winston realized that hewould have accepted three or even twotheres another room upstairs that you might care totake a look at he said theres not much in it just a fewpieces well do with a light if were going upstairshe lit another lamp and with bowed back led the wayslowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passageinto a room which did not give on the street but looked outon a cobbled yard and a forest of chimneypots winstonnoticed that the furniture was still arranged as though thefree

oldfashioned glass clock with a twelvehour face was ticking awayon the mantelpiece under the window and occupyingnearly a quarter of the room was an enormous bed withthe mattress still on itwe lived here till my wife died said the old man halfapologetically im selling the furniture off by little andlittle now thats a beautiful mahogany bed or at least itwould be if you could get the bugs out of it but i dare sayyoud find it a little bit cumbersomehe was holdlng the lamp high up so as to illuminate thewhole room and in the warm dim light the place lookedcuriously inviting the thought flitted through winstonsmind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the roomfor a few dollars a week if he dared to take the risk it was awild impossible notion to be abandoned as soon as thoughtof but the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia asort of ancestral memory it seemed to him that he knewexactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this in an armchair beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and akettle on the hob utterly alone utterly secure with nobodywatching you no voice pursuing you no sound except thesinging of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clocktheres no telescreen he could not help murmuringah said the old man i never had one of those thingstoo expensive and i never seemed to feel the need of itsomehow now thats a nice gateleg table in the corner there1221984though of course youd have to put new hinges on it if youwanted to use the flapsthere was a small bookcase in the other corner andwinston had already gravitated towards it it containednothing but rubbish the huntingdown and destruction ofbooks had been done with the same thoroughness in theprole quarters as everywhere else it was very unlikely thatthere existed anywhere in oceania a copy of a book printedearlier than 1960 the old man still carrying the lamp wasstanding in front of a picture in a rosewood frame whichhung on the other side of the fireplace opposite the bednow if you happen to be interested in old prints at all—— he began delicatelywinston came across to examine the picture it was asteel engraving of an oval building with rectangular windows and a small tower in front there was a railingrunning round the building and at the rear end there waswhat appeared to be a statue winston gazed at it for somemoments it seemed vaguely familiar though he did not remember the statuethe frames fixed to the wall said the old man but icould unscrew it for you i dare sayi know that building said winston finally its a ruinnow its in the middle of the street

a kind of a dance they held out theirarms for you to pass under and when they came to herecomes a chopper to chop off your head they brought theirarms down and caught you it was just names of churchesall the london churches were in it—all the principal onesthat iswinston wondered vaguely to what century the churchbelonged it was always difficult to determine the age of alondon building anything large and impressive if it wasreasonably new in appearance was automatically claimedas having been built since the revolution while anythingthat was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dimperiod called the middle ages the centuries of capitalismwere held to have produced nothing of any value one couldnot learn history from architecture any more than onecould learn it from books statues inscriptions memorial stones the names of streets—anything that might throwlight upon the past had been systematically alteredi never knew it had been a church he saidtheres a lot of them left

of various kinds—scale models ofrocket bombs and floating fortresses waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities and the likest martinsinthefields it used to be called supplemented the old man though i dont recollect any fieldsanywhere in those partswinston did not buy the picture it would have been aneven more incongruous possession than the glass paperweight and impossible to carry home unless it were takenout of its frame but he lingered for some minutes moretalking to the old man whose name he discovered was notweeks—as one might have gathered from the inscriptionover the shopfront—but charrington mr charrington itseemed was a widower aged sixtythree and had inhabited this shop for thirty years throughout that time he hadbeen intending to alter the name over the window but hadnever quite got to the point of doing it all the while thatthey were talking the halfremembered rhyme kept running through winstons head oranges and lemons say thebells of st clements you owe

that still existed somewhere or otherdisguised and forgotten from one ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth yet so far ashe could remember he had never in real life heard churchbells ringinghe got away from mr charrington and went down thestairs alone so as not to let the old man see him reconnoitring the street before stepping out of the door he hadalready made up his mind that after a suitable interval—amonth say—he would take the risk of visiting the shopagain it was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking anevening at the centre the serious piece of folly had been tocome back here in the first place after buying the diary andwithout knowing whether the proprietor of the shop couldbe trusted however——yes he thought again he would come back he wouldbuy further scraps of beautiful rubbish he would buy theengraving of st clement danes take it out of its frame andcarry it home concealed under the jacket of his overalls hewould drag the rest of that poem out of mr charringtonsmemory even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashed momentarily through his mind again forperhaps five seconds exaltation made him careless and hestepped out on to the pavement without so much as a preliminary glance through the window he had even startedhumming to an improvised tuneoranges and lemons say the bells of st clements youowe me three farthings say the——1261984suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water a figure in blue overalls was coming downthe pavement not ten metres away it was the girl from thefiction department the girl with dark hair the light wasfailing but there was no difficulty in recognizing her shelooked him straight in the face then walked quickly on asthough she had not seen himfor a few seconds winston was too paralysed to movethen he turned to the right and walked heavily away notnoticing for the moment that he was going in the wrongdirection at any rate one question was settled there wasno doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him shemust have followed him here because it was not crediblethat by pure chance she should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure backstreetkilometres distant from any quarter where party memberslived it was too great a coincidence whether she was reallyan agent of the thought police or simply an amateur spyactuated by officiousness hardly mattered it was enoughthat she was watching him probably she had seen him gointo the pub as wellit was an effort to walk the lump of glass in his pocketbanged against his thigh at each step and he was half minded to take it out and throw it away the worst thing was thepain in his belly for a couple of minutes he had the feelingthat he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon butthere would be no public lavatories in a quarter like thisthen the spasm passed leaving a dull ache behindthe street was a blind alley winston halted stoodfree ebooks at planet ebookcom127for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do thenturned round and began to retrace his steps as he turnedit occurred to him that the girl had only passed him threeminutes ago and that by running he could probably catchup with her he could keep on her track till they were insome quiet place and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone the piece of glass in his pocket would be heavyenough for the job but he abandoned the idea immediatelybecause even the thought of making any physical effort wasunbearable he could not run he could not strike a blowbesides she was young and lusty and would defend herselfhe thought also of hurrying to the community centre andstaying there till the place closed so as to establish a partialalibi for the evening but that too was impossible a deadlylassitude had taken hold of him all he wanted was to gethome quickly and then sit down and be quietit was after twentytwo hours when he got back to theflat the lights would be switched off at the main at twentythree thirty he went into the kitchen and swallowed nearlya teacupful of victory gin then he went to the table in thealcove sat down and took the diary out of the drawer buthe did not open it at once from the telescreen a brassy female voice was squalling a patriotic song he sat staring atthe marbled cover of the book trying without success toshut the voice out of his consciousnessit was at night that they came for you always at night theproper thing was to kill yourself before they got you undoubtedly some people did so many of the disappearanceswere actually suicides but it needed desperate courage to1281984kill yourself in a world where firearms or any quick andcertain poison were completely unprocurable he thoughtwith a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessnessof pain and fear the treachery of the human body whichalways freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when aspecial effort is needed he might have silenced the darkhaired girl if only he had acted quickly enough but preciselybecause of the extremity of his danger he had lost the powerto act it struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy but always againstones own body even now in spite of the gin the dull achein his belly made consecutive thought impossible and itis the same he perceived in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations on the battlefield in the torture chamber ona sinking ship the issues that you are fighting for are always forgotten because the body swells up until it fills theuniverse and even when you are not paralysed by fright orscreaming with pain life is a momenttomoment struggleagainst hunger or cold or sleeplessness against a sour stomach or an aching toothhe opened the diary it was important to write something down the woman on the telescreen had started a newsong her voice seemed to stick into his brain like jaggedsplinters of glass he tried to think of obrien for whomor to whom the diary was written but instead he beganthinking of the things that would happen to him after thethought police took him away it would not matter if theykilled you at once to be killed was what you expected butbefore death nobody spoke of such things yet everybodyfree ebooks at planet ebookcom129knew of them there was the routine of confession that hadto be gone through the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy the crack of broken bones the smashed teethand bloody clots of hairwhy did you have to endure it since the end was always the same why was it not possible to cut a few daysor weeks out of your life nobody ever escaped detectionand nobody ever failed to confess when once you had succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given dateyou would be dead why then did that horror which alterednothing have to lie embedded in future timehe tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of obrien we shall meet in the placewhere there is no darkness obrien had said to him heknew what it meant or thought he knew the place wherethere is no darkness was the imagined future which onewould never see but which by foreknowledge one couldmystically share in but with the voice from the telescreennagging at his ears he could not follow the train of thoughtfurther he put a cigarette in his mouth half the tobaccopromptly fell out on to his tongue a bitter dust which wasdifficult to spit out again the face of big brother swam intohis mind displacing that of obrien just as he had done afew days earlier he slid a coin out of his pocket and lookedat it the face gazed up at him heavy calm protecting butwhat kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustachelike a leaden knell the words came back at himwar is peace1301984freedom is slaveryignorance is strengthfree ebooks at planet ebookcom131part two1321984chapter 1it was the middle of the morning and winston had leftthe cubicle to go to the lavatorya solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the long brightlylit corridor it was the girl withdark hair four days had gone past since the evening whenhe had run into her outside the junkshop as she camenearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling not noticeable at a distance because it was of the same colour as heroveralls probably she had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plotsof novels were roughed in it was a common accident in thefiction departmentthey were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost flat on her face a sharp cry of pain waswrung out of her she must have fallen right on the injuredarm winston stopped short the girl had risen to her kneesher face had turned a milky yellow colour against whichher mouth stood out redder than ever her eyes were fixedon his with an appealing expression that looked more likefear than paina curious emotion stirred in winstons heart in front ofhim was an enemy who was trying to kill him in front ofhim also was a human creature in pain and perhaps witha broken bone already he had instinctively started forwardfree ebooks at planet ebookcom133to help her in the moment when he had seen her fall on thebandaged arm it had been as though he felt the pain in hisown bodyyoure hurt he saidits nothing my arm itll be all right in a secondshe spoke as though her heart were fluttering she hadcertainly turned very paleyou havent broken anythingno im all right it hurt for a moment thats allshe held out her free hand to him and he helped her upshe had regained some of her colour and appeared verymuch betterits nothing she repeated shortly i only gave my wrist abit of a bang thanks comradeand with that she walked on in the direction in whichshe had been going as briskly as though it had really beennothing the whole incident could not have taken as muchas half a minute not to let ones feelings appear in onesface was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinctand in any case they had been standing straight in front ofa telescreen when the thing happened nevertheless it hadbeen very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise forin the two or three seconds while he was helping her upthe girl had slipped something into his hand there was noquestion that she had done it intentionally it was something small and flat as he passed through the lavatory doorhe transferred it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of hisfingers it was a scrap of paper folded into a squarewhile he stood at the urinal he managed with a little1341984more fingering to get it unfolded obviously there must bea message of some kind written on it for a moment he wastempted to take it into one of the waterclosets and read itat once but that would be shocking folly as he well knewthere was no place where you could be more certain thatthe telescreens were watched continuouslyhe went back to his cubicle sat down threw the fragment of paper casually among the other papers on the deskput on his spectacles and hitched the speakwrite towardshim five minutes he told himself five minutes at thevery least his heart bumped in his breast with frighteningloudness fortunately the piece of work he was engaged onwas mere routine the rectification of a long list of figuresnot needing close attentionwhatever was written on the paper it must have somekind of political meaning so far as he could see there weretwo possibilities one much the more likely was that thegirl was an agent of the thought police just as he had fearedhe did not know why the thought police should choose todeliver their messages in such a fashion but perhaps theyhad their reasons the thing that was written on the papermight be a threat a summons an order to commit suicidea trap of some description but there was another wilderpossibility that kept raising its head though he tried vainly to suppress it this was that the message did not comefrom the thought police at all but from some kind of underground organization perhaps the brotherhood existedafter all perhaps the girl was part of it no doubt the ideawas absurd but it had sprung into his mind in the very infree ebooks at planet ebookcom135stant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand it was not tilla couple of minutes later that the other more probable explanation had occurred to him and even now though hisintellect told him that the message probably meant death—still that was not what he believed and the unreasonablehope persisted and his heart banged and it was with difficulty that he kept his voice from trembling as he murmuredhis figures into the speakwritehe rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid itinto the pneumatic tube eight minutes had gone by he readjusted his spectacles on his nose sighed and drew thenext batch of work towards him with the scrap of paper ontop of it he flattened it out on it was written in a large unformed handwritingi love youfor several seconds he was too stunned even to throwthe incriminating thing into the memory hole when hedid so although he knew very well the danger of showingtoo much interest he could not resist reading it once againjust to make sure that the words were really therefor the rest of the morning it was very difficult to workwhat was even worse than having to focus his mind on aseries of niggling jobs was the need to conceal his agitationfrom the telescreen he felt as though a fire were burningin his belly lunch in the hot crowded noisefilled canteenwas torment he had hoped to be alone for a little whileduring the lunch hour but as bad luck would have it the1361984imbecile parsons flopped down beside him the tang of hissweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew and kept upa stream of talk about the preparations for hate week hewas particularly enthusiastic about a papiermache model ofbig brothers head two metres wide which was being madefor the occasion by his daughters troop of spies the irritating thing was that in the racket of voices winston couldhardly hear what parsons was saying and was constantlyhaving to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated justonce he caught a glimpse of the girl at a table with two other girls at the far end of the room she appeared not to haveseen him and he did not look in that direction againthe afternoon was more bearable immediately after lunchthere arrived a delicate difficult piece of work which wouldtake several hours and necessitated putting everything elseaside it consisted in falsifying a series of production reports of two years ago in such a way as to cast discredit on aprominent member of the inner party who was now undera cloud this was the kind of thing that winston was goodat and for more than two hours he succeeded in shuttingthe girl out of his mind altogether then the memory of herface came back and with it a raging intolerable desire tobe alone until he could be alone it was impossible to thinkthis new development out tonight was one of his nights atthe community centre he wolfed another tasteless mealin the canteen hurried off to the centre took part in thesolemn foolery of a discussion group played two gamesof table tennis swallowed several glasses of gin and sat forhalf an hour through a lecture entitled ingsoc in relation tofree ebooks at planet ebookcom137chess his soul writhed with boredom but for once he hadhad no impulse to shirk his evening at the centre at thesight of the words i love you the desire to stay alive hadwelled up in him and the taking of minor risks suddenlyseemed stupid it was not till twentythree hours when hewas home and in bed—in the darkness where you were safeeven from the telescreen so long as you kept silent—that hewas able to think continuouslyit was a physical problem that had to be solved how toget in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting he didnot consider any longer the possibility that she might belaying some kind of trap for him he knew that it was notso because of her unmistakable agitation when she handedhim the note obviously she had been frightened out of herwits as well she might be nor did the idea of refusing heradvances even cross his mind only five nights ago he hadcontemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone butthat was of no importance he thought of her naked youthful body as he had seen it in his dream he had imaginedher a fool like all the rest of them her head stuffed with liesand hatred her belly full of ice a kind of fever seized him atthe thought that he might lose her the white youthful bodymight slip away from him what he feared more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if hedid not get in touch with her quickly but the physical difficulty of meeting was enormous it was like trying to makea move at chess when you were already mated whicheverway you turned the telescreen faced you actually all thepossible ways of communicating with her had occurred to1381984him within five minutes of reading the note but now withtime to think he went over them one by one as though laying out a row of instruments on a tableobviously the kind of encounter that had happened thismorning could not be repeated if she had worked in the records department it might have been comparatively simplebut he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the buildingthe fiction department lay and he had no pretext for goingthere if he had known where she lived and at what timeshe left work he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home but to try to follow her home wasnot safe because it would mean loitering about outside theministry which was bound to be noticed as for sendinga letter through the mails it was out of the question bya routine that was not even secret all letters were openedin transit actually few people ever wrote letters for themessages that it was occasionally necessary to send therewere printed postcards with long lists of phrases and youstruck out the ones that were inapplicable in any case hedid not know the girls name let alone her address finally he decided that the safest place was the canteen if hecould get her at a table by herself somewhere in the middleof the room not too near the telescreens and with a sufficient buzz of conversation all round—if these conditionsendured for say thirty seconds it might be possible to exchange a few wordsfor a week after this life was like a restless dream onthe next day she did not appear in the canteen until hewas leaving it the whistle having already blown presumfree ebooks at planet ebookcom139ably she had been changed on to a later shift they passedeach other without a glance on the day after that she wasin the canteen at the usual time but with three other girlsand immediately under a telescreen then for three dreadful days she did not appear at all his whole mind and bodyseemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity a sortof transparency which made every movement every soundevery contact every word that he had to speak or listento an agony even in sleep he could not altogether escapefrom her image he did not touch the diary during thosedays if there was any relief it was in his work in which hecould sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a stretchhe had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to herthere was no enquiry he could make she might have beenvaporized she might have committed suicide she mighthave been transferred to the other end of oceania worstand likeliest of all she might simply have changed her mindand decided to avoid himthe next day she reappeared her arm was out of the slingand she had a band of stickingplaster round her wrist therelief of seeing her was so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several seconds on the following dayhe very nearly succeeded in speaking to her when he cameinto the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from thewall and was quite alone it was early and the place wasnot very full the queue edged forward till winston wasalmost at the counter then was held up for two minutesbecause someone in front was complaining that he had notreceived his tablet of saccharine but the girl was still alone1401984when winston secured his tray and began to make for hertable he walked casually towards her his eyes searchingfor a place at some table beyond her she was perhaps threemetres away from him another two seconds would do itthen a voice behind him called smith he pretended notto hear smith repeated the voice more loudly it was nouse he turned round a blondheaded sillyfaced youngman named wilsher whom he barely knew was invitinghim with a smile to a vacant place at his table it was notsafe to refuse after having been recognized he could notgo and sit at a table with an unattended girl it was too noticeable he sat down with a friendly smile the silly blondface beamed into his winston had a hallucination of himself smashing a pickaxe right into the middle of it thegirls table filled up a few minutes laterbut she must have seen him coming towards her andperhaps she would take the hint next day he took care toarrive early surely enough she was at a table in about thesame place and again alone the person immediately aheadof him in the queue was a small swiftlymoving beetlelikeman with a flat face and tiny suspicious eyes as winstonturned away from the counter with his tray he saw that thelittle man was making straight for the girls table his hopessank again there was a vacant place at a table further awaybut something in the little mans appearance suggestedthat he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfortto choose the emptiest table with ice at his heart winstonfollowed it was no use unless he could get the girl aloneat this moment there was a tremendous crash the littlefree ebooks at planet ebookcom141man was sprawling on all fours his tray had gone flyingtwo streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floorhe started to his feet with a malignant glance at winstonwhom he evidently suspected of having tripped him up butit was all right five seconds later with a thundering heartwinston was sitting at the girls tablehe did not look at her he unpacked his tray and promptly began eating it was allimportant to speak at oncebefore anyone else came but now a terrible fear had

the monument reading or pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up thecolumn it was not safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated there were telescreens all round thepediment but at this moment there was a din of shoutingand a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the leftsuddenly everyone seemed to be running across the squarethe girl nipped nimbly round the lions at

still insatiably gaping at the start there had been a few boos and hisses butit came only from the party members among the crowdand had soon stopped the prevailing emotion was simplycuriosity foreigners whether from eurasia or from eastasia were a kind of strange animal one literally never sawthem except in the guise of prisoners and even as prisoners one never got more than a momentary

in the last truck he could see an aged man hisface a mass of grizzled hair standing upright with wristscrossed in front of him as though he were used to havingthem bound together it was almost time for winston andthe girl to part but at the last moment while the crowd still1461984hemmed them in her hand felt for his and gave it a fleetingsqueezeit could not have been ten seconds and yet it seemed along time that their hands were clasped together he hadtime to learn every detail of her hand he explored the longfingers the shapely nails the workhardened palm with itsrow of callouses the smooth flesh under the wrist merelyfrom feeling it he would have known it by sight in the sameinstant it occurred to him that he did not know what colourthe girls eyes were they were probably brown but peoplewith dark hair sometimes had blue eyes to turn his headand look at her would have been inconceivable folly withhands locked together invisible among the press of bodiesthey stared steadily

lane through dappledlight and shade stepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted under the trees to the left of himthe ground was misty with bluebells the air seemed to kissones skin it was the second of may from somewhere deeper in the heart of the wood came the droning of ring doveshe was a bit early there had been no difficulties aboutthe journey and the girl was so evidently experienced thathe was less frightened than he would normally have beenpresumably she could be trusted to find a safe place ingeneral you could not assume that you were much safer inthe country than in london there were no telescreens ofcourse but there was always the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice might be picked up andrecognized besides it was not easy to make a journey byyourself without attracting attention for distances of lessthan 100 kilometres it was not necessary to get your passport endorsed but sometimes there were patrols hangingabout the railway stations who examined the papers of anyparty member they found there and asked awkward questions however no patrols had appeared and on the walkfrom the station he had made sure by cautious backwardglances that he was not being followed the train was fullof proles in holiday mood because of the summery weather1481984the woodenseated carriage in which he travelled was filledto overflowing by a single enormous family ranging froma toothless greatgrandmother to a monthold baby goingout to spend an afternoon with inlaws in the country andas they freely explained to winston to get hold of a littleblackmarket butterthe lane widened and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told him of a mere cattletrack which plungedbetween the bushes he had no watch but it could not befifteen yet the bluebells were so thick underfoot that it wasimpossible not to tread on them he knelt down and beganpicking some partly to pass the time away but also froma vague idea that he would like to have a bunch of flowersto offer to the girl when they met he had got together abig bunch and was smelling their faint sickly scent when asound at his back froze him the unmistakable crackle of afoot on twigs he went on picking bluebells it was the bestthing to do it might be the girl or he might have been followed after all to look round was to show guilt he pickedanother and another a hand fell lightly on his shoulderhe looked up it was the girl she shook her head evidently as a warning that he must keep silent then partedthe bushes and quickly led the way along the narrow trackinto the wood obviously she had been that way before forshe dodged the boggy bits as though by habit winston followed still clasping his bunch of flowers his first feelingwas relief but as he watched the strong slender body moving in front of him with the scarlet sash that was just tightenough to bring out the curve of her hips the sense of hisfree ebooks at planet ebookcom149own inferiority was heavy upon him even now it seemedquite likely that when she turned round and looked at himshe would draw back after all the sweetness of the air andthe greenness of the leaves daunted him already on thewalk from the station the may sunshine had made him feeldirty and etiolated a creature of indoors with the sootydust of london in the pores of his skin it occurred to himthat till now she had probably never seen him in broad daylight in the open they came to the fallen tree that she hadspoken of the girl hopped over and forced apart the bushes in which there did not seem to be an opening whenwinston followed her he found that they were in a naturalclearing a tiny grassy knoll surrounded by tall saplings thatshut it in completely the girl stopped and turnedhere we are she saidhe was facing her at several paces distance as yet he didnot dare move nearer to heri didnt want to say anything in the lane she went onin case theres a mike hidden there i dont suppose there isbut there could be theres always the chance of one of thoseswine recognizing your voice were all right herehe still had not the courage to approach her were allright here he repeated stupidlyyes look at the trees they were small ashes which atsome time had been cut down and had sprouted up againinto a forest of poles none of them thicker than ones wristtheres nothing big enough to hide a mike in besides ivebeen here beforethey were only making conversation he had managed1501984to move closer to her now she stood before him very upright with a smile on her face that looked faintly ironical asthough she were wondering why he was so slow to act thebluebells had cascaded on to the ground they seemed tohave fallen of their own accord he took her handwould you believe he said that till this moment ididnt know

beginning he had no feeling exceptsheer incredulity the youthful body was strained againsthis own the mass of dark hair was against his face and yesactually she had turned her face up and he was kissing thewide red mouth she had clasped her arms about his neckshe was calling him darling precious one loved one hehad pulled her down on to the ground she was utterly unresisting he could do what he liked with her but the truthwas that he had no physical sensation except that of merecontact all he felt was incredulity and pride he was gladthat this was happening but he had no physical desire

killed offyes something of that kind a great many young girlsare like that you knowits this bloody thing that does it she said ripping offthe scarlet sash of the junior antisex league and flingingit on to a bough then as though touching her waist hadreminded her of something she felt in the pocket of heroveralls and produced a small slab of chocolate she brokeit in half and gave one of the pieces to winston even before he had taken it he knew by the smell that it was veryunusual chocolate it was dark and shiny and was wrappedin silver paper chocolate normally was dullbrown crumbly stuff that tasted as nearly as one could describe it likethe smoke of a rubbish fire but at some time or another hehad tasted chocolate like the piece she had given him thefirst whiff of its scent had stirred up some memory whichhe could not pin down but which was powerful and troublingwhere did you get this stuff he saidblack market she said indifferently actually i am thatsort of girl to look at im good at

young he said you are ten or fifteen yearsyounger than i am what could you see to attract you in aman like meit was something in your face i thought id take a chanceim good at spotting people who dont belong as soon as isaw you i knew you were against themthem it appeared meant the party and above all theinner party about whom she talked with an open jeeringhatred which made winston feel uneasy although he knewthat they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere athing that astonished him about her was the coarseness ofher language party members were supposed not to swearand winston himself very seldom did swear aloud at anyrate julia however seemed unable to mention the partyand especially the inner party without using the kind ofwords that you saw chalked up in dripping alleyways hedid not dislike it it was merely one symptom of her revoltagainst the party and all its ways and somehow it seemednatural and healthy like the sneeze of a horse that smellsbad hay they had left the clearing and were wanderingagain through the chequered shade with their arms roundeach others waists whenever it was wide enough to walktwo abreast he noticed how much softer her waist seemed1541984to feel now that the sash was gone they did not speak abovea whisper outside the clearing julia said it was better togo quietly presently they had reached the edge of the littlewood she stopped himdont go out into the open there might be someonewatching were all right if we keep behind the boughsthey were standing in the shade of hazel bushes thesunlight filtering through innumerable leaves was still hoton their faces winston looked out into the field beyondand underwent a curious slow shock of recognition heknew it by sight an old closebitten pasture with a footpath wandering across it and a molehill here and there inthe ragged hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elmtrees swayed just perceptibly in the breeze and their leavesstirred faintly in dense masses like womens hair surelysomewhere nearby but out of sight there must be a streamwith green pools where dace were swimmingisnt there a stream somewhere near here he whisperedthats right there is a stream its at the edge of the nextfield actually there are fish in it great big ones you canwatch them lying in the pools under the willow trees waving their tailsits the golden country—almost he murmuredthe golden countryits nothing really a landscape ive seen sometimes ina dreamlook whispered juliaa thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres awayfree ebooks at planet ebookcom155almost at the level of their faces perhaps it had not seenthem it was in the sun they in the shade it spread out itswings fitted them carefully into place again ducked itshead for a moment as though making a sort of obeisance tothe sun and then began to pour forth a torrent of song inthe afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling winston and julia clung together fascinated the music went onand on minute after minute with astonishing variationsnever once repeating itself almost as though the bird weredeliberately showing off its virtuosity sometimes it stoppedfor a few seconds spread out and resettled its wings thenswelled its speckled breast and again burst into song winston watched it with a sort of vague reverence for whom forwhat was that bird singing no mate no rival was watching it what made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood andpour its music into nothingness he wondered whether after all there was a microphone hidden somewhere near heand julia had spoken only in low whispers and it would notpick up what they had said but it would pick up the thrushperhaps at the other end of the instrument some small beetlelike man was listening intently—listening to that butby degrees the flood of music drove all speculations out ofhis mind it was as though it were a kind of liquid stuff thatpoured all over him and got mixed up with the sunlightthat filtered through the leaves he stopped thinking andmerely felt the girls waist in the bend of his arm was softand warm he pulled her round so that they were breastto breast her body seemed to melt into his wherever hishands moved it was all as yielding as water their mouths1561984clung together it was quite different from the hard kissesthey had exchanged earlier when they moved their facesapart again both of them sighed deeply the bird took frightand fled with a clatter of wingswinston put his lips against her ear now he whisperednot here she whispered back come back to the hideout its saferquickly with an occasional crackle of twigs theythreaded their way back to the clearing when they wereonce inside the ring of saplings she turned and faced himthey were both breathing fast but the smile had reappearedround the corners of her mouth she stood looking at himfor an instant then felt at the zipper of her overalls andyes it was almost as in his dream almost as swiftly as hehad imagined it she had torn her clothes off and when sheflung them aside it was with that same magnificent gestureby which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated herbody gleamed white in the sun but for a moment he didnot look at her body his eyes were anchored by the freckledface with its faint bold smile he knelt down before her andtook her hands in hishave you done this beforeof course hundreds of times—well scores of timesanywaywith party membersyes always with party memberswith members of the inner partynot with those swine no but theres plenty that wouldfree ebooks at planet ebookcom157if they got half a chance theyre not so holy as they makeouthis heart leapt scores of times she had done it he wishedit had been hundreds—thousands anything that hinted atcorruption always filled him with a wild hope who knewperhaps the party was rotten under the surface its cult ofstrenuousness and selfdenial simply a sham concealing iniquity if he could have infected the whole lot of them withleprosy or syphilis how gladly he would have done so anything to rot to weaken to undermine he pulled her downso that they were kneeling face to facelisten the more men youve had the more i love youdo you understand thatyes perfectlyi hate purity i hate goodness i dont want any virtueto exist anywhere i want everyone to be corrupt to theboneswell then i ought to suit you dear im corrupt to thebonesyou like doing this i dont mean simply me i mean thething in itselfi adore itthat was above all what he wanted to hear not merelythe love of one person but the animal instinct the simpleundifferentiated desire that was the force that would tearthe party to pieces he pressed her down upon the grassamong the fallen bluebells this time there was no difficulty presently the rising and falling of their breasts slowedto normal speed and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they1581984fell apart the sun seemed to have grown hotter they wereboth sleepy he reached out for the discarded overalls andpulled them partly over her almost immediately they fellasleep and slept for about half an hourwinston woke first he sat up and watched the freckled face still peacefully asleep pillowed on the palm of herhand except for her mouth you could not call her beautiful there was a line or two round the eyes if you lookedclosely the short dark hair was extraordinarily thick andsoft it occurred to him that he still did not know her surname or where she livedthe young strong body now helpless in sleep awoke inhim a pitying protecting feeling but the mindless tenderness that he had felt under the hazel tree while the thrushwas singing had not quite come back he pulled the overalls aside and studied her smooth white flank in the olddays he thought a man looked at a girls body and saw thatit was desirable and that was the end of the story but youcould not have pure love or pure lust nowadays no emotion was pure because everything was mixed up with fearand hatred their embrace had been a battle the climax avictory it was a blow struck against the party it was a political actfree ebooks at planet ebookcom159chapter 3we can come here once again said julia its generally safeto use any hideout twice but not for another month ortwo of courseas soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed shebecame alert and businesslike put her clothes on knotted the scarlet sash about her waist and began arrangingthe details of the journey home it seemed natural to leavethis to her she obviously had a practical cunning whichwinston lacked and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round london storedaway from innumerable community hikes the route shegave him was quite different from the one by which he hadcome and brought him out at a different railway stationnever go home the same way as you went out she said asthough enunciating an important general principle shewould leave first and winston was to wait half an hour before following hershe had named a place where they could meet after workfour evenings hence it was a street in one of the poorerquarters where there was an open market which was generally crowded and noisy she would be hanging about amongthe stalls pretending to be in search of shoelaces or sewingthread if she judged that the coast was clear she would blowher nose when he approached otherwise he was to walk1601984past her without recognition but with luck in the middleof the crowd it would be safe to talk for a quarter of an hourand arrange another meetingand now i must go she said as soon as he had masteredhis instructions im due back at nineteenthirty ive got toput in two hours for the junior antisex league handingout leaflets or something isnt it bloody give me a brushdown would you have i got any twigs in my hair are yousure then goodbye my love goodbyeshe flung herself into his arms kissed him almost violently and a moment later pushed her way through thesaplings and disappeared into the wood with very littlenoise even now he had not found out her surname or heraddress however it made no difference for it was inconceivable that they could ever meet indoors or exchange anykind of written communicationas it happened they never went back to the clearing inthe wood during the month of may there was only onefurther occasion on which they actually succeeded in making love that was in another hidlngplace known to juliathe belfry of a ruinous church in an almostdeserted stretchof country where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty yearsearlier it was a good hidingplace when once you got therebut the getting there was very dangerous for the rest theycould meet only in the streets in a different place every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time in thestreet it was usually possible to talk after a fashion as theydrifted down the crowded pavements not quite abreastand never looking at one another they carried on a curifree ebooks at planet ebookcom161ous intermittent conversation which flicked on and off likethe beams of a lighthouse suddenly nipped into silence bythe approach of a party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen then taken up again minutes later in the middle ofa sentence then abruptly cut short as they parted at theagreed spot then continued almost without introductionon the following day julia appeared to be quite used to thiskind of conversation which she called talking by instalments she was also surprisingly adept at speaking withoutmoving her lips just once in almost a month of nightlymeetings they managed to exchange a kiss they were passing in silence down a sidestreet julia would never speakwhen they were away from the main streets when there wasa deafening roar the earth heaved and the air darkenedand winston found himself lying on his side bruised andterrified a rocket bomb must have dropped quite near athand suddenly he became aware of julias face a few centimetres from his own deathly white as white as chalk evenher lips were white she was dead he clasped her againsthim and found that he was kissing a live warm face butthere was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his lipsboth of their faces were thickly coated with plasterthere were evenings when they reached their rendezvousand then had to walk past one another without a sign because a patrol had just come round the corner or a helicopterwas hovering overhead even if it had been less dangerousit would still have been difficult to find time to meet winstons working week was sixty hours julias was even longerand their free days varied according to the pressure of work1621984and did not often coincide julia in any case seldom had anevening completely free she spent an astonishing amountof time in attending lectures and demonstrations distributing literature for the junior antisex league preparingbanners for hate week making collections for the savingscampaign and suchlike activities it paid she said it wascamouflage if you kept the small rules you could break thebig ones she even induced winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for the parttimemunition work which was done voluntarily by zealous party members so one evening every week winston spentfour hours of paralysing boredom screwing together smallbits of metal which were probably parts of bomb fuses in adraughty illlit workshop where the knocking of hammersmingled drearily with the music of the telescreenswhen they met in the church tower the gaps in theirfragmentary conversation were filled up it was a blazing afternoon the air in the little square chamber above the bellswas hot and stagnant and smelt overpoweringly of pigeondung they sat talking for hours on the dusty twiglitteredfloor one or other of them getting up from time to time tocast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that noone was comingjulia was twentysix years old she lived in a hostel withthirty other girls always in the stink of women how ihate women she said parenthetically and she worked ashe had guessed on the novelwriting machines in the fiction department she enjoyed her work which consistedchiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky elecfree ebooks at planet ebookcom163tric motor she was not clever but was fond of using herhands and felt at home with machinery she could describethe whole process of composing a novel from the generaldirective issued by the planning committee down to thefinal touchingup by the rewrite squad but she was not interested in the finished product she didnt much care forreading she said books were just a commodity that had tobe produced like jam or bootlacesshe had no memories of anything before the early sixties and the only person she had ever known who talkedfrequently of the days before the revolution was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight at schoolshe had been captain of the hockey team and had won thegymnastics trophy two years running she had been a troopleader in the spies and a branch secretary in the youthleague before joining the junior antisex league she hadalways borne an excellent character she had even an infallible mark of good reputation been picked out to work inpornosec the subsection of the fiction department whichturned out cheap pornography for distribution among theproles it was nicknamed muck house by the people whoworked in it she remarked there she had remained for ayear helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles like spanking stories or one night in a girls schoolto be bought furtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that they were buying something illegalwhat are these books like said winston curiouslyoh ghastly rubbish theyre boring really they onlyhave six plots but they swap them round a bit of course1641984i was only on the kaleidoscopes i was never in the rewritesquad im not literary dear—not even enough for thathe learned with astonishment that all the workers inpornosec except the heads of the departments were girlsthe theory was that men whose sex instincts were less controllable than those of women were in greater danger ofbeing corrupted by the filth they handledthey dont even like having married women there sheadded girls are always supposed to be so pure heres onewho isnt anywayshe had had her first loveaffair when she was sixteenwith a party member of sixty who later committed suicideto avoid arrest and a good job too said julia otherwisetheyd have had my name out of him when he confessedsince then there had been various others life as she saw itwas quite simple you wanted a good time they meaningthe party wanted to stop you having it you broke the rulesas best you could she seemed to think it just as natural thatthey should want to rob you of your pleasures as that youshould want to avoid being caught she hated the party andsaid so in the crudest words but she made no general criticism of it except where it touched upon her own life shehad no interest in party doctrine he noticed that she neverused newspeak words except the ones that had passed intoeveryday use she had never heard of the brotherhood andrefused to believe in its existence any kind of organizedrevolt against the party which was bound to be a failurestruck her as stupid the clever thing was to break the rulesand stay alive all the same he wondered vaguely how manyfree ebooks at planet ebookcom165others like her there might be in the younger generationpeople who had grown up in the world of the revolutionknowing nothing else accepting the party as somethingunalterable like the sky not rebelling against its authoritybut simply evading it as a rabbit dodges a dogthey did not discuss the possibility of getting marriedit was too remote to be worth thinking about no imaginable committee would ever sanction such a marriage evenif katharine winstons wife could somehow have been gotrid of it was hopeless even as a daydreamwhat was she like your wife said juliashe was—do you know the newspeak word goodthinkful meaning naturally orthodox incapable ofthinking a bad thoughtno i didnt know the word but i know the kind of person right enoughhe began telling her the story of his married life but curiously enough she appeared to know the essential parts ofit already she described to him almost as though she hadseen or felt it the stiffening of katharines body as soonas he touched her the way in which she still seemed to bepushing him from her with all her strength even when herarms were clasped tightly round him with julia he felt nodifficulty in talking about such things katharine in anycase had long ceased to be a painful memory and becamemerely a distasteful onei could have stood it if it hadnt been for one thing hesaid he told her about the frigid little ceremony that katharine had forced him to go through on the same night every1661984week she hated it but nothing would make her stop doingit she used to call it—but youll never guessour duty to the party said julia promptlyhow did you know thative been at school too dear sex talks once a month forthe oversixteens and in the youth movement they rub itinto you for years i dare say it works in a lot of cases but ofcourse you can never tell people are such hypocritesshe began to enlarge upon the subject with julia everything came back to her own sexuality as soon as this wastouched upon in any way she was capable of great acutenessunlike winston she had grasped the inner meaning of thepartys sexual puritanism it was not merely that the sexinstinct created a world of its own which was outside thepartys control and which therefore had to be destroyed ifpossible what was more important was that sexual privation induced hysteria which was desirable because it couldbe transformed into warfever and leaderworship the wayshe put it waswhen you make love youre using up energy and afterwards you feel happy and dont give a damn for anythingthey cant bear you to feel like that they want you to bebursting with energy all the time all this marching up anddown and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sourif youre happy inside yourself why should you get excitedabout big brother and the threeyear plans and the twominutes hate and all the rest of their bloody rotthat was very true he thought there was a direct intimate connexion between chastity and political orthodoxyfree ebooks at planet ebookcom167for how could the fear the hatred and the lunatic credulitywhich the party needed in its members be kept at the rightpitch except by bottling down some powerful instinct andusing it as a driving force the sex impulse was dangerous tothe party and the party had turned it to account they hadplayed a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood thefamily could not actually be abolished and indeed peoplewere encouraged to be fond of their children in almost theoldfashioned way the children on the other hand weresystematically turned against their parents and taught tospy on them and report their deviations the family hadbecome in effect an extension of the thought police it wasa device by means of which everyone could be surroundednight and day by informers who knew him intimatelyabruptly his mind went back to katharine katharinewould unquestionably have denounced him to the thoughtpolice if she had not happened to be too stupid to detect theunorthodoxy of his opinions but what really recalled herto him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoonwhich had brought the sweat out on his forehead he begantelling julia of something that had happened or rather hadfailed to happen on another sweltering summer afternooneleven years agoit was three or four months after they were married theyhad lost their way on a community hike somewhere in kentthey had only lagged behind the others for a couple of minutes but they took a wrong turning and presently foundthemselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalkquarry it was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres with1681984boulders at the bottom there was nobody of whom theycould ask the way as soon as she realized that they werelost katharine became very uneasy to be away from thenoisy mob of hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling ofwrongdoing she wanted to hurry back by the way they hadcome and start searching in the other direction but at thismoment winston noticed some tufts of loosestrife growingin the cracks of the cliff beneath them one tuft was of twocolours magenta and brickred apparently growing on thesame root he had never seen anything of the kind beforeand he called to katharine to come and look at itlook katharine look at those flowers that clumpdown near the bottom do you see theyre two different coloursshe had already turned to go but she did rather fretfullycome back for a moment she even leaned out over the cliffface to see where he was pointing he was standing a littlebehind her and he put his hand on her waist to steady herat this moment it suddenly occurred to him how completelyalone they were there was not a human creature anywherenot a leaf stirring not even a bird awake in a place likethis the danger that there would be a hidden microphonewas very small and even if there was a microphone it wouldonly pick up sounds it was the hottest sleepiest hour of theafternoon the sun blazed down

against him her head rested on his shoulder the pleasant smell of her hair conquering the pigeondung she was very young he thought she still expectedsomething from life she did not understand that to push aninconvenient person over a cliff solves nothingactually it would have made no difference he saidthen why are you sorry you didnt do itonly because i prefer a positive to a negative in thisgame that were playing we cant win some kinds of failureare better than other kinds thats allhe felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent she always contradicted him when he said anything of this kindshe would not accept it as a law of nature that the individual is always defeated in a way she realized that she herselfwas doomed that sooner or later the thought police wouldcatch her and kill her but with another part of her mindshe believed that it was somehow possible to construct a secret world in which you could live as you chose all youneeded was luck and cunning and boldness she did not understand that there was no such thing as happiness that theonly victory lay in the far future long after you were deadthat from the moment of declaring war on the party it wasbetter to think of yourself as a corpsewe are the dead he said1701984were not dead yet said julia prosaicallynot physically six months a year—five years conceivably i am afraid of death you are young so presumablyyoure more afraid of it than i am obviously we shall put itoff as long as we can but it makes very little difference solong as human beings stay human death and life are thesame thingoh rubbish which would

saying conscious gratuitoussuicidal folly of all the crimes that a party member couldcommit this one was the least possible to conceal actually the idea had first floated into his head in the form of avision of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface ofthe gateleg table as he had foreseen mr charrington hadmade no difficulty about letting the room he was obviouslyglad of the few dollars that it would bring him nor did heseem shocked or become offensively knowing when it wasmade clear that winston wanted the room for the purposeof a loveaffair instead he looked into the middle distance1721984and spoke in generalities with so delicate an air as to givethe impression that he had become partly invisible privacyhe said was a very valuable thing everyone wanted a placewhere they could be alone occasionally and when they hadsuch a place it was only common courtesy in anyone elsewho knew of it to keep his knowledge to himself he evenseeming almost to fade out of existence as he did so added that there were two entries to the house one of themthrough the back yard which gave on an alleyunder the window somebody was singing winstonpeeped out secure in the protection of the muslin curtainthe june sun was still high in the sky and in the sunfilledcourt below a monstrous woman solid as a norman pillar with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strappedabout her middle was stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothes line pegging out a series of square whitethings which winston recognized as babies diapers whenever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she wassinging in a powerful contraltoit was only an opeless fancyit passed like an ipril dyebut a look an a word an the dreams they stirredthey avestolen my eart awyethe tune had been haunting london for weeks past itwas one of countless similar songs published for the benefit of the proles by a subsection of the music departmentfree ebooks at planet ebookcom173the words of these songs were composed without any human intervention whatever on an instrument known as aversificator but the woman sang so tunefully as to turn thedreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant sound he couldhear the woman singing and the scrape of her shoes on theflagstones and the cries of the children in the street andsomewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic and yetthe room seemed curiously silent thanks to the absence ofa telescreenfolly folly folly he thought again it was inconceivable that they could frequent this place for more than a fewweeks without being caught but the temptation of having ahidingplace that was truly their own indoors and near athand had been too much for both of them for some timeafter their visit to the church belfry it had been impossibleto arrange meetings working hours had been drasticallyincreased in anticipation of hate week it was more thana month distant but the enormous complex preparationsthat it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybodyfinally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon onthe same day they had agreed to go back to the clearingin the wood on the evening beforehand they met brieflyin the street as usual winston hardly looked at julia asthey drifted towards one another in the crowd but fromthe short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she waspaler than usualits all off she murmured as soon as she judged it safe tospeak tomorrow i meanwhat1741984tomorrow afternoon i cant comewhy notoh the usual reason its started early this timefor a moment he was violently angry during the monththat he had known her the nature of his desire for her hadchanged at the beginning there had been little true sensuality in it their first lovemaking had been simply an actof the will but after the second time it was different thesmell of her hair the taste of her mouth the feeling of herskin seemed to have got inside him or into the air all roundhim she had become a physical necessity something thathe not only wanted but felt that he had a right to when shesaid that she could not come he had the feeling that she wascheating him but just at this moment the crowd pressedthem together and their hands accidentally met she gavethe tips of his fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but affection it struck him that when onelived with a woman this particular disappointment must bea normal recurring event and a deep tenderness such ashe had not felt for her before suddenly took hold of him hewished that they were a married couple of ten years standing he wished that he were walking through the streetswith her just as they were doing now but openly and without fear talking of trivialities and buying odds and endsfor the household he wished above all that they had someplace where they could be alone together without feelingthe obligation to make love every time they met it was notactually at that moment but at some time on the followingday that the idea of renting mr charringtons room had ocfree ebooks at planet ebookcom175curred to him when he suggested it to julia she had agreedwith unexpected readiness both of them knew that it waslunacy it was as though they were intentionally steppingnearer to their graves as he sat waiting on the edge of thebed he thought again of the cellars of the ministry of loveit was curious how that predestined horror moved in andout of ones consciousness there it lay fixed in future timespreceding death as surely as 99 precedes 100 one could notavoid it but one could perhaps postpone it and yet insteadevery now and again by a conscious wilful act one choseto shorten the interval before it happenedat this moment there was a quick step on the stairs juliaburst into the room she was carrying a toolbag of coarsebrown canvas such as he had sometimes seen her carryingto and fro at the ministry he started forward to take her inhis arms but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly partlybecause she was still holding the toolbaghalf a second she said just let me show you what ivebrought did you bring some of that filthy victory coffeei thought you would you can chuck it away again becausewe shant be needing it look hereshe fell on her knees threw open the bag and tumbledout some spanners and a screwdriver that filled the top partof it underneath were a number of neat paper packets thefirst packet that she passed to winston had a strange andyet vaguely familiar feeling it was filled with some kind ofheavy sandlike stuff which yielded wherever you toucheditit isnt sugar he said1761984real sugar not saccharine sugar and heres a loaf ofbread—proper white bread not our bloody stuff—and a little pot of jam and heres a tin of milk—but look this is theone im really proud of i had to wrap a bit of sacking roundit because——but she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped itup the smell was already filling the room a rich hot smellwhich seemed like an emanation from his early childhoodbut

murmured real coffeeits inner party coffee theres a whole kilo here shesaidhow did you manage to get hold of all these thingsits all inner party stuff theres nothing those swinedont have nothing but of course waiters and servants andpeople pinch things and—look i got a little packet of teaas wellwinston had squatted down beside her he tore open acorner of the packetits real tea not blackberry

marchingto and fro between the washtub and the line she took twomore pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep feelingthey sye that time eals all thingsthey sye you can always forgetbut the smiles an the tears acrorss the yearsthey twist myeartstrings yetshe knew the whole drivelling song by heart it seemedher voice floated upward with the sweet summer air verytuneful charged with a sort of happy melancholy one hadthe feeling that she would have been perfectly content if thejune evening had been endless and the supply of clothes inexhaustible to remain there for a thousand years peggingout diapers and singing rubbish it struck him as a curiousfact that he had never heard a member of the party singingalone and spontaneously it would even have seemed slightlyunorthodox a dangerous eccentricity like talking to oneself perhaps it was only when people were somewhere nearthe starvation level that they had anything to sing aboutyou can turn round now said juliahe turned round and for a second almost failed to recognize her what he had actually expected was to see hernaked but she was not naked the transformation that hadhappened was much more surprising than that she hadpainted her faceshe must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian1781984quarters and bought herself a complete set of makeup materials her lips were deeply reddened her cheeks rougedher nose powdered there was even a touch of somethingunder the eyes to make them brighter it was not very skilfully done but winstons standards in such matters werenot high he had never before seen or imagined a woman ofthe party with cosmetics on her face the improvement inher appearance was startling with just a few dabs of colourin the right places she had become not only very much prettier but above all far more feminine her short hair andboyish overalls merely added to the effect as he took her inhis arms a wave of synthetic violets flooded his nostrils heremembered the halfdarkness of a basement kitchen and awomans cavernous mouth it was the very same scent thatshe had used but at the moment it did not seem to matterscent too he saidyes dear scent too and do you know what im going todo next im going to get hold of a real womans frock fromsomewhere and wear it instead of these bloody trousers illwear silk stockings and highheeled shoes in this room imgoing to be a woman not a party comradethey flung their clothes off and climbed into the hugemahogany bed it was the first time that he had strippedhimself naked in her presence until now he had been toomuch ashamed of his pale and meagre body with the varicose veins standing out on his calves and the discolouredpatch over his ankle there were no sheets but the blanketthey lay on was threadbare and smooth and the size andspringiness of the bed astonished both of them its surefree ebooks at planet ebookcom179to be full of bugs but who cares said julia one never sawa double bed nowadays except in the homes of the proleswinston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood juliahad never been in one before so far as she could rememberpresently they fell asleep for a little while when winston woke up the hands of the clock had crept round tonearly nine he did not stir because julia was sleeping withher head in the crook of his arm most of her makeup hadtransferred itself to his own face or the bolster but a lightstain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbonea yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of thebed and lighted up the fireplace where the water in the panwas boiling fast down in the yard the woman had stoppedsinging but the faint shouts of children floated in from thestreet he wondered vaguely whether in the abolished pastit had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this inthe cool of a summer evening a man and a woman with noclothes on making love when they chose talking of whatthey chose not feeling any compulsion to get up simply lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside surelythere could never have been a time when that seemed ordinary julia woke up rubbed her eyes and raised herself onher elbow to look at the oilstovehalf that waters boiled away she said ill get up andmake some coffee in another moment weve got an hourwhat time do they cut the lights off at your flatstwentythree thirtyits twentythree at the hostel but you have to get in earlier than that because—hi get out you filthy brute1801984she suddenly twisted herself over in the bed seized ashoe from the floor and sent it hurtling into the corner witha boyish jerk of her arm exactly as he had seen her fling thedictionary at goldstein that morning during the two minutes hatewhat was it he said in surprisea rat i saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting theres a hole down there i gave him a good frightanywayrats murmured winston in this roomtheyre all over the place said julia indifferently as shelay down again weve even got them in the kitchen at thehostel some parts of london are swarming with them didyou know they attack children yes they do in some ofthese streets a woman darent leave a baby alone for twominutes its the great huge brown ones that do it and thenasty thing is that the brutes always——dont go on said winston with his eyes tightlyshutdearest youve gone quite pale whats the matter dothey make you feel sickof all horrors in the world—a ratshe pressed herself against him and wound her limbsround him as though to reassure him with the warmthof her body he did not reopen his eyes immediately forseveral moments he had had the feeling of being back in anightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life it was always very much the same he wasstanding in front of a wall of darkness and on the otherfree ebooks at planet ebookcom181side of it there was something unendurable something toodreadful to be faced in the dream his deepest feeling wasalways one of selfdeception because he did in fact knowwhat was behind the wall of darkness with a deadly effortlike wrenching a piece out of his own brain he could evenhave dragged the thing into the open he always woke upwithout discovering what it was but somehow it was connected with what julia had been saying when he cut hershortim sorry he said its nothing i dont like rats thatsalldont worry dear were not going to have the filthybrutes in here ill stuff the hole with a bit of sacking beforewe go and next time we come here ill bring some plasterand bung it up properlyalready the black instant of panic was halfforgottenfeeling slightly ashamed of himself he sat up against thebedhead julia got out of bed pulled on her overalls andmade the coffee the smell that rose from the saucepan wasso powerful and exciting that they shut the window lestanybody outside should notice it and become inquisitivewhat was even better than the taste of the coffee was thesilky texture given to it by the sugar a thing winston hadalmost forgotten after years of saccharine with one handin her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other julia wandered about the room glancing indifferently at thebookcase pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table plumping herself down in the ragged armchair tosee if it was comfortable and examining the absurd twelve1821984hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement she broughtthe glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in abetter light he took it out of her hand fascinated as alwaysby the soft rainwatery appearance of the glasswhat is it do you think said juliai dont think its anything—i mean i dont think it wasever put to any use thats what i like about it its a littlechunk of history that theyve forgotten to alter its a message from a hundred years ago if one knew how to read itand that picture over there—she nodded at the engraving on the opposite wall—would that be a hundred yearsoldmore two hundred i dare say one cant tell its impossible to discover the age of anything nowadaysshe went over to look at it heres where that brute stuckhis nose out she said kicking the wainscoting immediately below the picture what is this

lipstick off your face afterwardswinston did not get up for a few minutes more theroom was darkening he turned over towards the light andlay gazing into the glass paperweight the inexhaustiblyinteresting thing was not the fragment of coral but the interior of the glass itself there was such a depth of it andyet it was almost as transparent as air it was as though thesurface of the glass had been the arch of the sky enclosinga tiny world with its atmosphere complete he had the feeling that he could get inside it and that in fact he was inside1841984it along with the mahogany

mentioned him onthe third day winston went into the vestibule of the records department to look at the noticeboard one of thenotices carried a printed list of the members of the chesscommittee of whom syme had been one it looked almostexactly as it had looked before—nothing had been crossedout—but it was one name shorter it was enough syme hadceased to exist he had never existedthe weather was

looked at the poster the muzzle of thegun magnified by the foreshortening seemed to be pointed straight at you the thing had been plastered on everyblank space on every wall even outnumbering the portraits of big brother the proles normally apathetic aboutthe war were being lashed into one of their periodical frenzies of patriotism as though to harmonize with the generalmood the rocket bombs

for the sake of coolnessthe rat had never come back but the bugs had multipliedhideously in the heat it did not seem to matter dirty orclean the room was paradise as soon as they arrived theywould sprinkle everything with pepper bought on the blackmarket tear off their clothes and make love with sweatingbodies then fall asleep and wake to find that the bugs hadrallied and were massing for the counterattackfour five six—seven times they met during the monthof june winston had dropped his habit of drinking gin atall hours he seemed to have lost the need for it he hadgrown fatter his varicose ulcer had subsided leaving onlya brown stain on the skin above his ankle his fits of coughing in the early morning had stopped the process of lifehad ceased to be intolerable he had no longer any impulseto make faces at the telescreen or shout curses at the top ofhis voice now that they had a secure hidingplace almost ahome it did not even seem a hardship that they could onlymeet infrequently and for a couple of hours at a time whatmattered was that the room over the junkshop should existto know that it was there inviolate was almost the same asbeing in it the room was a world a pocket of the past whereextinct animals could walk mr charrington thought winston was another extinct animal he usually stopped to talkwith mr charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairsthe old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doorsfree ebooks at planet ebookcom189and on the other hand to have almost no customers heled a ghostlike existence between the tiny dark shop andan even tinier back kitchen where he prepared his mealsand which contained among other things an unbelievablyancient gramophone with an enormous horn he seemedglad of the opportunity to talk wandering about amonghis worthless stock with his long nose and thick spectaclesand his bowed shoulders in the velvet jacket he had alwaysvaguely the air of being a collector rather than a tradesmanwith a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger this scrapof rubbish or that—a china bottlestopper the painted lid ofa broken snuffbox a pinchbeck locket containing a strandof some longdead babys hair—never asking that winstonshould buy it merely that he should admire it to talk tohim was like listening to the tinkling of a wornout musicalbox he had dragged out from the corners of his memorysome more fragments of forgotten rhymes there was oneabout four and twenty blackbirds and another about a cowwith a crumpled horn and another about the death of poorcock robin it just occurred to me you might be interestedhe would say with a deprecating little laugh whenever heproduced a new fragment but he could never recall morethan a few lines of any one rhymeboth of them knew—in a way it was never out of theirminds that what was now happening could not last longthere were times when the fact of impending death seemedas palpable as the bed they lay on and they would cling together with a sort of despairing sensuality like a damnedsoul grasping at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock1901984is within five minutes of striking but there were also timeswhen they had the illusion not only of safety but of permanence so long as they were actually in this room theyboth felt no harm could come to them getting there wasdifficult and dangerous but the room itself was sanctuaryit was as when winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight with the feeling that it would be possible to getinside that glassy world and that once inside it time couldbe arrested often they gave themselves up to daydreams ofescape their luck would hold indefinitely and they wouldcarry on their intrigue just like this for the remainder oftheir natural lives or katharine would die and by subtlemanoeuvrings winston and julia would succeed in getting married or they would commit suicide together orthey would disappear alter themselves out of recognitionlearn to speak with proletarian accents get jobs in a factoryand live out their lives undetected in a backstreet it wasall nonsense as they both knew in reality there was no escape even the one plan that was practicable suicide theyhad no intention of carrying out to hang on from day today and from week to week spinning out a present that hadno future seemed an unconquerable instinct just as oneslungs will always draw the next breath so long as there isair availablesometimes too they talked of engaging in active rebellion against the party but with no notion of how to takethe first step even if the fabulous brotherhood was a reality there still remained the difficulty of finding ones wayinto it he told her of the strange intimacy that existed orfree ebooks at planet ebookcom191seemed to exist between himself and obrien and of theimpulse he sometimes felt simply to walk into obrienspresence announce that he was the enemy of the party anddemand his help curiously enough this did not strike heras an impossibly rash thing to do she was used to judging people by their faces and it seemed natural to her thatwinston should believe obrien to be trustworthy on thestrength of a single flash of the eyes moreover she took itfor granted that everyone or nearly everyone secretly hatedthe party and would break the rules if he thought it safe todo so but she refused to believe that widespread organizedopposition existed or could exist the tales about goldsteinand his underground army she said were simply a lot ofrubbish which the party had invented for its own purposesand which you had to pretend to believe in times beyondnumber at party rallies and spontaneous demonstrationsshe had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution ofpeople whose names she had never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not the faintest belief when publictrials were happening she had taken her place in the detachments from the youth league who surrounded the courtsfrom morning to night chanting at intervals death to thetraitors during the two minutes hate she always excelledall others in shouting insults at goldstein yet she had onlythe dimmest idea of who goldstein was and what doctrineshe was supposed to represent she had grown up since therevolution and was too young to remember the ideologicalbattles of the fifties and sixties such a thing as an independent political movement was outside her imagination and1921984in any case the party was invincible it would always exist and it would always be the same you could only rebelagainst it by secret disobedience or at most by isolated actsof violence such as killing somebody or blowing somethingupin some ways she was far more acute than winston andfar less susceptible to party propaganda once when hehappened in some connexion to mention the war againsteurasia she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening the rocket bombs which felldaily on london were probably fired by the governmentof oceania itself just to keep people frightened this wasan idea that had literally never occurred to him she alsostirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during thetwo minutes hate her great difficulty was to avoid burstingout laughing but she only questioned the teachings of theparty when they in some way touched upon her own lifeoften she was ready to accept the official mythology simplybecause the difference between truth and falsehood did notseem important to her she believed for instance havinglearnt it at school that the party had invented aeroplanesin his own schooldays winston remembered in the latefifties it was only the helicopter that the party claimed tohave invented a dozen years later when julia was at schoolit was already claiming the aeroplane one generation moreand it would be claiming the steam engine and when hetold her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he wasborn and long before the revolution the fact struck her astotally uninteresting after all what did it matter who hadfree ebooks at planet ebookcom193invented aeroplanes it was rather more of a shock to himwhen he discovered from some chance remark that she didnot remember that oceania four years ago had been at warwith eastasia and at peace with eurasia it was true that sheregarded the whole war as a sham but apparently she hadnot even noticed that the name of the enemy had changedi thought wed always been at war with eurasia she saidvaguely it frightened him a little the invention of aeroplanes dated from long before her birth but the switchoverin the war had happened only four years ago well after shewas grown up he argued with her about it for perhaps aquarter of an hour in the end he succeeded in forcing hermemory back until she did dimly recall that at one timeeastasia and not eurasia had been the enemy but the issuestill struck her as unimportant who cares she said impatiently its always one bloody war after another and oneknows the news is all lies anywaysometimes he talked to her of the records departmentand the impudent forgeries that he committed there suchthings did not appear to horrify her she did not feel theabyss opening beneath her feet at the thought of lies becoming truths he told her the story of jones aaronson andrutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he hadonce held between his fingers it did not make much impression on her at first indeed she failed to grasp the pointof the storywere they friends of yours she saidno i never knew them they were inner party membersbesides they were far older men than i was they belonged1941984to the old days before the revolution i barely knew themby sightthen what was there to worry about people are beingkilled off all the time arent theyhe tried to make her understand this was an exceptional case it wasnt just a question of somebody beingkilled do you realize that the past starting from yesterday has been actually abolished if it survives anywhereits in a few solid objects with no words attached to themlike that lump of glass there already we know almost literally nothing about the revolution and the years beforethe revolution every record has been destroyed or falsified every book has been rewritten every picture has beenrepainted every statue and street and building has beenrenamed every date has been altered and that process iscontinuing day by day and minute by minute history hasstopped nothing exists except an endless present in whichthe party is always right i know of course that the past isfalsified but it would never be possible for me to prove iteven when i did the falsification myself after the thing isdone no evidence ever remains the only evidence is insidemy own mind and i dont know with any certainty that anyother human being shares my memories just in that oneinstance in my whole life i did possess actual concrete evidence after the event—years after itand what good was thatit was no good because i threw it away a few minutes later but if the same thing happened today i should keep itwell i wouldnt said julia im quite ready to takefree ebooks at planet ebookcom195risks but only for something worth while not for bits ofold newspaper what could you have done with it even ifyou had kept itnot much perhaps but it was evidence it might haveplanted a few doubts here and there supposing that iddared to show it to anybody i dont imagine that we canalter anything in our own lifetime but one can imagine little knots of resistance springing up here and there—smallgroups of people banding themselves together and gradually growing and even leaving a few records behind so thatthe next generations can carry on where we leave offim not interested in the next generation dear im interested in usyoure only a rebel from the waist downwards he toldhershe thought this brilliantly witty and flung her armsround him in delightin the ramifications of party doctrine she had not thefaintest interest whenever he began to talk of the principles of ingsoc doublethink the mutability of the past andthe denial of objective reality and to use newspeak wordsshe became bored and confused and said that she never paidany attention to that kind of thing one knew that it was allrubbish so why let oneself be worried by it she knew whento cheer and when to boo and that was all one needed if hepersisted in talking of such subjects she had a disconcertinghabit of falling asleep she was one of those people who cango to sleep at any hour and in any position talking to herhe realized how easy it was to present an appearance of or1961984thodoxy while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxymeant in a way the worldview of the party imposed itselfmost successfully on people incapable of understanding itthey could be made to accept the most flagrant violationsof reality because they never fully grasped the enormityof what was demanded of them and were not sufficientlyinterested in public events to notice what was happeningby lack of understanding they remained sane they simplyswallowed everything and what they swallowed did themno harm because it left no residue behind just as a grain ofcorn will pass

happenhe was walking down the long corridor at the ministry and he was almost at the spot where julia had slippedthe note into his hand when he became aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him theperson whoever it was gave a small cough evidently as aprelude to speaking winston stopped abruptly and turnedit was obrienat last they were face to face and it seemed that his onlyimpulse was to run away his heart bounded violently hewould have been incapable of speaking obrien howeverhad continued forward in the same movement laying afriendly hand for a moment on winstons arm so that thetwo of them were walking side by side he began speaking with the peculiar grave courtesy that differentiated himfrom the majority of inner party membersi had been hoping for an

remark must obviouslyhave been intended as a signal a codeword by sharing asmall act of thoughtcrime he had turned the two of theminto accomplices they had continued to stroll slowly downthe corridor but now obrien halted with the curious disarming friendliness that he always managed to put in to thegesture he resettled his spectacles on his nose then he wentonwhat i had really intended to say was that in your articlei noticed you had used two words which have become obsolete but they have only become so very recently have youseen the tenth edition of the newspeak dictionaryno said winston i didnt think it had been issued yetwe are still using the ninth in the records departmentthe tenth edition is not due to appear for some monthsi believe but a few advance copies have been circulatedi have one myself it might interest you to look at it perhapsvery much so said winston immediately seeing wherefree ebooks at planet ebookcom199this tendedsome of the new developments are most ingenious thereduction in the number of verbs—that is the point that willappeal to you i think let me see shall i send a messengerto you with the dictionary but i am afraid i invariably forget anything of that kind perhaps you could pick it up atmy flat at some time that suited you wait let me give youmy addressthey were standing in front of a telescreen somewhatabsentmindedly obrien felt two of his pockets and thenproduced a small leathercovered notebook and a goldinkpencil immediately beneath the telescreen in such aposition that anyone who was watching at the other end ofthe instrument could read what he was writing he scribbledan address tore out the page and handed it to winstoni am usually at home in the evenings he said if not myservant will give you the dictionaryhe was gone leaving winston holding the scrap of paperwhich this time there was no need to conceal neverthelesshe carefully memorized what was written on it and somehours later dropped it into the memory hole along with amass of other papersthey had been talking to one another for a couple ofminutes at the most there was only one meaning that theepisode could possibly have it had been contrived as a wayof letting winston know obriens address this was necessary because except by direct enquiry it was never possibleto discover where anyone lived there were no directoriesof any kind if you ever want to see me this is where i can2001984be found was what obrien had been saying to him perhaps there would even be a message concealed somewherein the dictionary but at any rate one thing was certain theconspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist and he hadreached the outer edges of ithe knew that sooner or later he would obey obrienssummons perhaps tomorrow perhaps after a long delay—he was not certain what was happening was only theworkingout of a process that had started years ago thefirst step had been a secret involuntary thought the second had been the opening of the diary he had moved fromthoughts to words and now from words to actions the laststep was something that would happen in the ministry oflove he had accepted it the end was contained in the beginning but it was frightening or more exactly it was likea foretaste of death like being a little less alive even whilehe was speaking to obrien when the meaning of the wordshad sunk in a chilly shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body he had the sensation of stepping into thedampness of a grave and it was not much better becausehe had always known that the grave was there and waitingfor himfree ebooks at planet ebookcom201chapter 7winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears julia rolled sleepily against him murmuring somethingthat might have been whats the matteri dreamt— he began and stopped short it was too complex to be put into words there was the dream itself andthere was a memory connected with it that had swum intohis mind in the few seconds after wakinghe lay back with his eyes shut still sodden in the atmosphere of the dream it was a vast luminous dream in whichhis whole life seemed to stretch out before him like a landscape on a summer evening after rain it had all occurredinside the glass paperweight but the surface of the glasswas the dome of the sky and inside the dome everythingwas flooded with clear soft light in which one could see intointerminable distances the dream had also been comprehended by—indeed in some sense it had consisted in—agesture of the arm made by his mother and made againthirty years later by the jewish woman he had seen on thenews film trying to shelter the small boy from the bulletsbefore the helicopter blew them both to piecesdo you know he said that until this moment i believedi had murdered my motherwhy did you murder her said julia almost asleepi didnt murder her not physically2021984in the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of hismother and within a few moments of waking the clusterof small events surrounding it had all come back it was amemory that he must have deliberately pushed out of hisconsciousness over many years he was not certain of thedate but he could not have been less than ten years old possibly twelve when it had happenedhis father had disappeared some time earlier how muchearlier he could not remember he remembered better therackety uneasy circumstances of the time the periodicalpanics about airraids and the sheltering in tube stationsthe piles of rubble everywhere the unintelligible proclamations posted at street corners the gangs of youths inshirts all the same colour the enormous queues outsidethe bakeries the intermittent machinegun fire in the distance—above all the fact that there was never enough toeat he remembered long afternoons spent with other boysin scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps pickingout the ribs of cabbage leaves potato peelings sometimeseven scraps of stale breadcrust from which they carefullyscraped away the cinders and also in waiting for the passing of trucks which travelled over a certain route and wereknown to carry cattle feed and which when they joltedover the bad patches in the road sometimes spilt a few fragments of oilcakewhen his father disappeared his mother did not showany surprise or any violent grief but a sudden change cameover her she seemed to have become completely spiritlessit was evident even to winston that she was waiting forfree ebooks at planet ebookcom203something that she knew must happen she did everythingthat was needed—cooked washed mended made the bedswept the floor dusted the mantelpiece—always very slowlyand with a curious lack of superfluous motion like an artists layfigure moving of its own accord her large shapelybody seemed to relapse naturally into stillness for hoursat a time she would sit almost immobile on the bed nursing his young sister a tiny ailing very silent child of twoor three with a face made simian by thinness very occasionally she would take winston in her arms and press himagainst her for a long time without saying anything he wasaware in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness that thiswas somehow connected with the nevermentioned thingthat was about to happenhe remembered the room where they lived a dark closesmelling room that seemed half filled by a bed with a whitecounterpane there was a gas ring in the fender and a shelfwhere food was kept and on the landing outside there wasa brown earthenware sink common to several rooms heremembered his mothers statuesque body bending over thegas ring to stir at something in a saucepan above all heremembered his continuous hunger and the fierce sordidbattles at mealtimes he would ask his mother nagginglyover and over again why there was not more food he wouldshout and storm at her he even remembered the tones ofhis voice which was beginning to break prematurely andsometimes boomed in a peculiar way or he would attempta snivelling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than hisshare his mother was quite ready to give him more than2041984his share she took it for granted that he the boy shouldhave the biggest portion but however much she gave himhe invariably demanded more at every meal she would beseech him not to be selfish and to remember that his littlesister was sick and also needed food but it was no use hewould cry out with rage when she stopped ladling he wouldtry to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of her hands hewould grab bits from his sisters plate he knew that he wasstarving the other two but he could not help it he even feltthat he had a right to do it the clamorous hunger in his belly seemed to justify him between meals if his mother didnot stand guard he was constantly pilfering at the wretchedstore of food on the shelfone day a chocolateration was issued there had beenno such issue for weeks or months past he rememberedquite clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate it was atwoounce slab they still talked about ounces in those daysbetween the three of them it was obvious that it ought tobe divided into three equal parts suddenly as though hewere listening to somebody else winston heard himselfdemanding in a loud booming voice that he should be given the whole piece his mother told him not to be greedythere was a long nagging argument that went round andround with shouts whines tears remonstrances bargainings his tiny sister clinging to her mother with both handsexactly like a baby monkey sat looking over her shoulder athim with large mournful eyes in the end his mother brokeoff threequarters of the chocolate and gave it to winstongiving the other quarter to his sister the little girl took holdfree ebooks at planet ebookcom205of it and looked at it dully perhaps not knowing what it waswinston stood watching her for a moment then with asudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolateout of his sisters hand and was fleeing for the doorwinston winston his mother called after him comeback give your sister back her chocolatehe stopped but did not come back his mothers anxious eyes were fixed on his face even now he was thinkingabout the thing he did not know what it was that was onthe point of happening his sister conscious of having beenrobbed of something had set up a feeble wail his motherdrew her arm round the child and pressed its face againsther breast something in the gesture told him that his sister was dying he turned and fled down the stairs with thechocolate growing sticky in his handhe never saw his mother again after he had devouredthe chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed of himself andhung about in the streets for several hours until hungerdrove him home when he came back his mother had disappeared this was already becoming normal at that timenothing was gone from the room except his mother and hissister they had not taken any clothes not even his mothersovercoat to this day he did not know with any certaintythat his mother was dead it was perfectly possible that shehad merely been sent to a forcedlabour camp as for hissister she might have been removed like winston himselfto one of the colonies for homeless children reclamationcentres they were called which had grown up as a resultof the civil war or she might have been sent to the labour2061984camp along with his mother or simply left somewhere orother to diethe dream was still vivid in his mind especially the enveloping protecting gesture of the arm in which its wholemeaning seemed to be contained his mind went back toanother dream of two months ago exactly as his motherhad sat on the dingy whitequilted bed with the child clinging to her so she had sat in the sunken ship far underneathhim and drowning deeper every minute but still lookingup at him through the darkening waterhe told julia the story of his mothers disappearancewithout opening her eyes she rolled over and settled herselfinto a more comfortable positioni expect you were a beastly little swine in those days shesaid indistinctly all children are swineyes but the real point of the story——from her breathing it was evident that she was goingoff to sleep again he would have liked to continue talkingabout his mother he did not suppose from what he couldremember of her that she had been an unusual woman stillless an intelligent one and yet she had possessed a kind ofnobility a kind of purity simply because the standards thatshe obeyed were private ones her feelings were her ownand could not be altered from outside it would not haveoccurred to her that an action which is ineffectual therebybecomes meaningless if you loved someone you loved himand when you had nothing else to give you still gave himlove when the last of the chocolate was gone his motherhad clasped the child in her arms it was no use it changedfree ebooks at planet ebookcom207nothing it did not produce more chocolate it did not avertthe childs death or her own but it seemed natural to her todo it the refugee woman in the boat had also covered thelittle boy with her arm which was no more use against thebullets than a sheet of paper the terrible thing that the party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses merefeelings were of no account while at the same time robbingyou of all power over the material world when once youwere in the grip of the party what you felt or did not feelwhat you did or refrained from doing made literally no difference whatever happened you vanished and neither younor your actions were ever heard of again you were liftedclean out of the stream of history and yet to the peopleof only two generations ago this would not have seemedallimportant because they were not attempting to alterhistory they were governed by private loyalties which theydid not question what mattered were individual relationships and a completely helpless gesture an embrace a teara word spoken to a dying man could have value in itselfthe proles it suddenly occurred to him had remained inthis condition they were not loyal to a party or a country oran idea they were loyal to one another for the first time inhis life he did not despise the proles or think of them merelyas an inert force which would one day spring to life and regenerate the world the proles had stayed human they hadnot become hardened inside they had held on to the primitive emotions which he himself had to relearn by consciouseffort and in thinking this he remembered without apparent relevance how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed2081984hand lying on the pavement and had kicked it into the gutter as though it had been a cabbagestalkthe proles are human beings he said aloud we are nothumanwhy not said julia who had woken up againhe thought for a little while has it ever occurred to youhe said that the best thing for us to do would be simply towalk out of here before its too late and never see each otheragainyes dear it has occurred to me several times but imnot going to do it all the sameweve been lucky he said but it cant last much longeryoure young you look normal and innocent if you keepclear of people like me you might stay alive for another fiftyyearsno ive thought it all out what you do im going to doand dont be too downhearted im rather good at stayingalivewe may be together for another six months—a year—theres no knowing at the end were certain to be apart doyou realize how utterly alone we shall be when once theyget hold of us there will be nothing literally nothing thateither of us can do for the other if i confess theyll shootyou and if i refuse to confess theyll shoot you just the samenothing that i can do or say or stop myself from saying willput off your death for as much as five minutes neither of uswill even know whether the other is alive or dead we shallbe utterly without power of any kind the one thing thatmatters is that we shouldnt betray one another althoughfree ebooks at planet ebookcom209even that cant make the slightest differenceif you mean confessing she said we shall do that rightenough everybody always confesses you cant help it theytorture youi dont mean confessing confession is not betrayalwhat you say or do doesnt matter only feelings matter ifthey could make me stop loving you—that would be thereal betrayalshe thought it over they cant do that she said finally its the one thing they cant do they can make you sayanything—anything—but they cant make you believeit they cant get inside youno he said a little more hopefully no thats quite truethey cant get inside you if you can feel that staying human is worth while even when it cant have any resultwhatever youve beaten themhe thought of the telescreen with its neversleeping earthey could spy upon you night and day but if you kept yourhead you could still outwit them with all their clevernessthey had never mastered the secret of finding out what another human being was thinking perhaps that was less truewhen you were actually in their hands one did not knowwhat happened inside the ministry of love but it was possible to guess tortures drugs delicate instruments thatregistered your nervous reactions gradual wearingdownby sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioningfacts at any rate could not be kept hidden they could betracked down by enquiry they could be squeezed out of youby torture but if the object was not to stay alive but to stay2101984human what difference did it ultimately make they couldnot alter your feelings for that matter you could not alterthem yourself even if you wanted to they could lay bare inthe utmost detail everything that you had done or said orthought but the inner heart whose workings were mysterious even to yourself remained impregnablefree ebooks at planet ebookcom211chapter 8they had done it they had done it at lastthe room they were standing in was longshaped andsoftly lit the telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur therichness of the darkblue carpet gave one the impression oftreading on velvet at the far end of the room obrien wassitting at a table under a greenshaded lamp with a mass ofpapers on either side of him he had not bothered to look upwhen the servant showed julia and winston inwinstons heart was thumping so hard that he doubtedwhether he would be able to speak they had done it theyhad done it at last was all he could think it had been a rashact to come here at all and sheer folly to arrive togetherthough it was true that they had come by different routesand only met on obriens doorstep but merely to walk intosuch a place needed an effort of the nerve it was only onvery rare occasions that one saw inside the dwellingplaces of the inner party or even penetrated into the quarterof the town where they lived the whole atmosphere of thehuge block of flats the richness and spaciousness of everything the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobaccothe silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down thewhitejacketed servants hurrying to and fro—everythingwas intimidating although he had a good pretext for coming here he was haunted at every step by the fear that a2121984blackuniformed guard would suddenly appear from roundthe corner demand his papers and order him to get outobriens servant however had admitted the two of themwithout demur he was a small darkhaired man in a whitejacket with a diamondshaped completely expressionlessface which might have been that of a chinese the

whose walls were not grimyfrom the contact of human bodiesobrien had a slip of paper between his fingers andseemed to be studying it intently his heavy face bent downso that one could see the line of

him with thenewspeak words but his expression was grimmer thanfree ebooks at planet ebookcom213usual as though he were not pleased at being disturbed theterror that winston already felt was suddenly shot throughby a streak of ordinary embarrassment it seemed to himquite possible that he had simply made a stupid mistakefor what evidence had he in reality that obrien was anykind of political conspirator nothing but a flash of the eyesand a single equivocal remark beyond that only his ownsecret imaginings founded on a dream he could not evenfall back on the pretence that he had come to borrow thedictionary because in that case julias presence was impossible to explain as obrien passed the telescreen a thoughtseemed to strike him he stopped turned aside and presseda switch on the wall there was a sharp snap the voice hadstoppedjulia uttered a tiny sound a sort of squeak of surpriseeven in the midst of his panic winston was too much takenaback to be able to hold his tongueyou can turn it off he saidyes said obrien we can turn it off we have that privilegehe was opposite them now his solid form toweredover the pair of them and the expression on his face wasstill indecipherable he was waiting somewhat sternly forwinston to speak but about what even now it was quiteconceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he had been interrupted nobody spoke afterthe stopping of the telescreen the room seemed deadly silent the seconds marched past enormous with difficultywinston continued to keep his eyes fixed on obriens then2141984suddenly the grim face broke down into what might havebeen the beginnings of a smile with his characteristic gesture obrien resettled his spectacles on his noseshall i say it or will you he saidi will say it said winston promptly that thing is reallyturned offyes everything is turned off we are alonewe have come here because——he paused realizing for the first time the vagueness ofhis own motives since he did not in fact know what kindof help he expected from obrien it was not easy to say whyhe had come here he went on conscious that what he wassaying must sound both feeble and pretentiouswe believe that there is some kind of conspiracy somekind of secret organization working against the party andthat you are involved in it we want to join it and work for itwe are enemies of the party we disbelieve in the principlesof ingsoc we are thoughtcriminals we are also adulterers i tell you this because we want to put ourselves at yourmercy if you want us to incriminate ourselves in any otherway we are readyhe stopped and glanced over his shoulder with thefeeling that the door had opened sure enough the little yellowfaced servant had come in without knocking winstonsaw that he was carrying a tray with a decanter and glassesmartin is one of us said obrien impassively bringthe drinks over here martin put them on the round tablehave we enough chairs then we may as well sit down andtalk in comfort bring a chair for yourself martin this isfree ebooks at planet ebookcom215business you can stop being a servant for the next ten minutesthe little man sat down quite at his ease and yet stillwith a servantlike air the air of a valet enjoying a privilege winston regarded him out of the corner of his eyeit struck him that the mans whole life was playing a partand that he felt it to be dangerous to drop his assumed personality even for a moment obrien took the decanter bythe neck and filled up the glasses with a darkred liquid itaroused in winston dim memories of something seen longago on a wall or a hoarding—a vast bottle composed of electric lights which seemed to move up and down and pour itscontents into a glass seen from the top the stuff looked almost black but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby it hada soursweet smell he saw julia pick up her glass and sniffat it with frank curiosityit is called wine said obrien with a faint smile youwill have read about it in books no doubt not much of itgets to the outer party i am afraid his face grew solemnagain and he raised his glass i think it is fitting that weshould begin by drinking a health to our leader to emmanuel goldsteinwinston took up his glass with a certain eagerness winewas a thing he had read and dreamed about like the glasspaperweight or mr charringtons halfremembered rhymesit belonged to the vanished romantic past the olden timeas he liked to call it in his secret thoughts for some reasonhe had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweettaste like that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxi2161984cating effect actually when he came to swallow it the stuffwas distinctly disappointing the truth was that after yearsof gindrinking he could barely taste it he set down theempty glassthen there is such a person as goldstein he saidyes there is such a person and he is alive where i donot knowand the conspiracy—the organization is it real it is notsimply an invention of the thought policeno it is real the brotherhood we call it you will neverlearn much more about the brotherhood than that it existsand that you belong to it i will come back to that presently he looked at his wristwatch it is unwise even formembers of the inner party to turn off the telescreen formore than half an hour you ought not to have come heretogether and you will have to leave separately you comrade—he bowed his head to julia—will leave first we haveabout twenty minutes at our disposal you will understandthat i must start by asking you certain questions in generalterms what are you prepared to doanything that we are capable of said winstonobrien had turned himself a little in his chair so that hewas facing winston he almost ignored julia seeming totake it for granted that winston could speak for her for amoment the lids flitted down over his eyes he began askinghis questions in a low expressionless voice as though thiswere a routine a sort of catechism most of whose answerswere known to him alreadyyou are prepared to give your livesfree ebooks at planet ebookcom217yesyou are prepared to commit murderyesto commit acts of sabotage which may cause the deathof

if and when we order you to do soyesyou are prepared the two of you to separate and neversee one another againno broke in juliait appeared to winston that a long time passed beforehe answered for a moment he seemed even to have been2181984deprived of the power of speech his tongue worked soundlessly forming the opening syllables first of one word thenof the other over and over again until he had said it hedid not know which word he was going to say no he saidfinallyyou did well to tell me said obrien it is necessary forus to know everythinghe turned himself toward julia and added in a voicewith somewhat more expression in itdo you understand that even if he survives it may beas a different person we may be obliged to give him a newidentity his face his movements the shape of his handsthe colour of his hair—even his voice would be differentand you yourself might have become a different personour surgeons can alter people beyond recognition sometimes it is necessary sometimes we even amputate a limbwinston could not help snatching another sidelongglance at martins mongolian face there were no scarsthat he could see julia had turned a shade paler so thather freckles were showing but she faced obrien boldly shemurmured something that seemed to be assentgood then that is settledthere was a silver box of cigarettes on the table with arather absentminded air obrien pushed them towards theothers took one himself then stood up and began to paceslowly to and fro as though he could think better standingthey were very good cigarettes very thick and wellpackedwith an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper obrien looked athis wristwatch againfree ebooks at planet ebookcom219you had better go back to your pantry martin he saidi shall switch on in a quarter of an hour take a good lookat these comrades faces before you go you will be seeingthem again i may notexactly as they had done at the front door the little mansdark eyes flickered over their faces there was not a traceof friendliness in his manner he was memorizing theirappearance but he felt no interest in them or appearedto feel none it occurred to winston that a synthetic facewas perhaps incapable of changing its expression withoutspeaking or giving any kind of salutation martin went outclosing the door silently behind him obrien was strollingup and down one hand in the pocket of his black overallsthe other holding his cigaretteyou understand he said that you will be fighting inthe dark you will always be in the dark you will receiveorders and you will obey them without knowing why lateri shall send you a book from which you will learn the truenature of the society we live in and the strategy by whichwe shall destroy it when you have read the book you willbe full members of the brotherhood but between the general aims that we are fighting for and the immedi ate tasksof the moment you will never know anything i tell youthat the brotherhood exists but i can not tell you whether it numbers a hundred members or ten million fromyour personal knowledge you will never be able to say thatit numbers even as many as a dozen you will have threeor four contacts who will be renewed from time to timeas they disappear as this was your first contact it will be2201984preserved when you receive orders they will come fromme if we find it necessary to communicate with you it willbe through martin when you are finally caught you willconfess that is unavoidable but you will have very littleto confess other than your own actions you will not beable to betray more than a handful of unimportant peopleprobably you will not even betray me by that time i may bedead or i shall have become a different person with a different facehe continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet inspite of the bulkiness of his body there was a remarkablegrace in his movements it came out even in the gesturewith which he thrust a hand into his pocket or manipulated a cigarette more even than of strength he gave animpression of confidence and of an understanding tingedby irony however much in earnest he might be he hadnothing of the singlemindedness that belongs to a fanaticwhen he spoke of murder suicide venereal disease amputated limbs and altered faces it was with a faint air ofpersiflage this is unavoidable his voice seemed to saythis is what we have got to do unflinchingly but this isnot what we shall be doing when life is worth living againa wave of admiration almost of worship flowed out fromwinston towards obrien for the moment he had forgotten the shadowy figure of goldstein when you looked atobriens powerful shoulders and his bluntfeatured face sougly and yet so civilized it was impossible to believe thathe could be defeated there was no stratagem that he wasnot equal to no danger that he could not foresee even juliafree ebooks at planet ebookcom221seemed to be impressed she had let her cigarette go out andwas listening intently obrien went onyou will have heard rumours of the existence of thebrotherhood no doubt you have formed your own pictureof it you have imagined probably a huge underworld ofconspirators meeting secretly in cellars scribbling messages on walls recognizing one another by codewords or byspecial movements of the hand nothing of the kind existsthe members of the brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another and it is impossible for any one member tobe aware of the identity of more than a few others goldstein himself if he fell into the hands of the thought policecould not give them a complete list of members or any information that would lead them to a complete list no suchlist exists the brotherhood can not be wiped out because itis not an organization in the ordinary sense nothing holdsit together except an idea which is indestructible you willnever have anything to sustain you except the idea youwill get no comradeship and no encouragement when finally you are caught you will get no help we never helpour members at most when it is absolutely necessary thatsomeone should be silenced we are occasionally able tosmuggle a razor blade into a prisoners cell you will haveto get used to living without results and without hope youwill work for a while you will be caught you will confessand then you will die those are the only results that youwill ever see there is no possibility that any perceptiblechange will happen within our own lifetime we are thedead our only true life is in the future we shall take part2221984in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone but how faraway that future may be there is no knowing it might bea thousand years at present nothing is possible except toextend the area of sanity little by little we can not act collectively we can only spread our knowledge outwards fromindividual to individual generation after generation in theface of the thought police there is no other wayhe halted and looked for the third time at his wristwatchit is almost time for you to leave comrade he said to julia wait the decanter is still half fullhe filled the glasses and raised his own glass by thestemwhat shall it be this time he said still with the samefaint suggestion of irony to the confusion of the thoughtpolice to the death of big brother to humanity to thefutureto the past said winstonthe past is more important agreed obrien gravelythey emptied their glasses and a moment later juliastood up to go obrien took a small box from the top of acabinet and handed her a flat white tablet which he told herto place on her tongue it was important he said not to goout smelling of wine the lift attendants were very observant as soon as the door had shut behind her he appearedto forget her existence he took another pace or two up anddown then stoppedthere

later we will arrangesomething else for you it is important to change ones hidingplace frequently meanwhile i shall send you a copy ofthe book—even obrien winston noticed seemed topronounce the words as though they were in italics—goldsteins book you understand as soon as possible it maybe some days before i can get hold of one there are notmany in existence as you can imagine the thought

nodarkness he said hesitantlyobrien nodded without appearance of surprise in theplace where there is no darkness he said as though he hadrecognized the allusion and in the meantime is there anything that you wish to say before you leave any messageany questionwinston thought there did not seem to be any furtherquestion that he wanted to ask still less did he feel anyimpulse to utter highsounding generalities instead of anything directly connected with obrien or the brotherhoodthere came into his mind a sort of composite picture of thedark bedroom where his mother had spent her last daysand the little room over mr charringtons shop and theglass paperweight and the steel engraving in its rosewoodframe almost at random he saiddid you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that beginsoranges and lemons say the bells of st clementsagain obrien nodded with a sort of grave courtesy hecompleted the stanzaoranges and lemons say the bells of st clementsyou owe me three farthings say the bells of st

rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets the tramp of marching feet the grindingof the caterpillars of tanks the roar of massed planes thebooming of guns—after six days of this when the great orgasm was quivering to its climax and the general hatred ofeurasia had boiled up into such delirium that if the crowdcould have got their hands on the 2000 eurasian warcriminals who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of theproceedings they would unquestionably have torn themto pieces—at just this moment it had been announced thatoceania was not after all at war with eurasia oceania wasat war with eastasia eurasia was an allythere was of course no admission that any change hadtaken place merely it became known with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once that eastasia and noteurasia was the enemy winston was taking part in a demonstration in one of the central london squares at themoment when it happened it was night and the white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly floodlit the squarewas packed with several thousand people including a blockof about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of thespies on a scarletdraped platform an orator of the innerparty a small lean man with disproportionately long armsand a large bald skull over which a few lank locks straggled was haranguing the crowd a little rumpelstiltskinfigure contorted with hatred he gripped the neck of

of atrocities massacres deportations lootings rapings torture of prisoners bombingof civilians lying propaganda unjust aggressions brokentreaties it was almost impossible to listen to him withoutbeing first convinced and then maddened at every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of thespeaker was drowned by a wild beastlike roaring that roseuncontrollably from thousands of throats the most savage yells of all came from the schoolchildren the speechhad been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when amessenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paperwas slipped into the speakers hand he unrolled and read itwithout pausing in his speech nothing altered in his voiceor manner or in the content of what he was saying but suddenly the names were different without words said a waveof understanding rippled through the crowd oceania wasat war with eastasia the next moment there was a tremendous commotion the banners and posters with which thesquare was decorated were all wrong quite half of themhad the wrong faces on them it was sabotage the agents ofgoldstein had been at work there was a riotous interludewhile posters were ripped from the walls banners torn toshreds and trampled underfoot the spies performed prodigies of activity in clambering over the rooftops and cuttingthe streamers that fluttered from the chimneys but withintwo or three minutes it was all over the orator still grippingfree ebooks at planet ebookcom229the neck of the microphone his shoulders hunched forwardhis free hand clawing at the air had gone straight on withhis speech one minute more and the feral roars of ragewere again bursting from the crowd the hate continuedexactly as before except that the target had been changedthe thing that impressed winston in looking back wasthat the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually in midsentence not only without a pause but withouteven breaking the syntax but at the moment he had otherthings to preoccupy him it was during the moment of disorder while the posters were being torn down that a manwhose face he did not see had tapped him on the shoulderand said excuse me i think youve dropped your briefcase he took the briefcase abstractedly without speakinghe knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity to look inside it the instant that the demonstration wasover he went straight to the ministry of truth though thetime was now nearly twentythree hours the entire staffof the ministry had done likewise the orders already issuing from the telescreen recalling them to their posts werehardly necessaryoceania was at war with eastasia oceania had alwaysbeen at war with eastasia a large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete reportsand records of all kinds

within one week no reference to the war with eurasia2301984or the alliance with eastasia should remain in existenceanywhere the work was overwhelming all the more sobecause the processes that it involved could not be calledby their true names everyone in the records departmentworked eighteen hours in the twentyfour with two threehour snatches of sleep mattresses were brought up fromthe

spells of sleep he tried toleave his desk clear of work and each time that he crawledback stickyeyed and aching it was to find that anothershower of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift halfburying the speakwrite and overflowing on to thefloor so that the first job was always to stack them into aneat enough pile to give him room to work what was worstof all was that the work was by no means purely mechanicaloften it was enough merely to substitute one name for another but any detailed report of events demanded care andimagination even the geographical knowledge that oneneeded in transferring the war from one part of the worldto another was considerableby the third day his eyes ached unbearably and hisspectacles needed wiping every few minutes it was

absorption of europe by russia and of the british empire bythe united states two of the three existing powers eurasiaand oceania were already effectively in being the thirdeastasia only emerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting the frontiers between the threesuperstates are in some places arbitrary and in others theyfluctuate according to the fortunes of war but in generalthey follow geographical lines eurasia comprises the wholeof the northern part of the european and asiatic landmassfrom portugal to the bering strait oceania comprises theamericas the atlantic islands including the british islesaustralasia and the southern portion of africa eastasiasmaller than the others and with a less definite westernfrontier comprises china and the countries to the south of2341984it the japanese islands and a large but fluctuating portionof manchuria mongolia and tibetin one combination or another these three superstatesare permanently at war and have been so for the past twentyfive years war however is no longer the desperateannihilating struggle that it was in the early decades of thetwentieth century it is a warfare of limited aims betweencombatants who are unable to destroy one another have nomaterial cause for fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference this is not to say that either theconduct of war or the prevailing attitude towards it has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous on the contrarywar hysteria is continuous and universal in all countriesand such acts as raping looting the slaughter of childrenthe reduction of whole populations to slavery and reprisalsagainst prisoners which extend even to boiling and buryingalive are looked upon as normal and when they are committed by ones own side and not by the enemy meritoriousbut in a physical sense war involves very small numbers ofpeople mostly highlytrained specialists and causes comparatively few casualties the fighting when there is anytakes place on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts theaverage man can only guess at or round the floating fortresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes in thecentres of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage of consumption goods and the occasionalcrash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few scores ofdeaths war has in fact changed its character more exactlythe reasons for which war is waged have changed in theirfree ebooks at planet ebookcom235order of importance motives which were already presentto some small extent in the great wars of the early twentiethcentuury have now become dominant and are consciouslyrecognized and acted uponto understand the nature of the present war—for in spiteof the regrouping which occurs every few years it is always the same war—one must realize in the first place thatit is impossible for it to be decisive none of the three superstates could be definitively conquered even by the othertwo in combination they are too evenly matched and theirnatural defences are too formidable eurasia is protected byits vast land spaces oceania by the width of the atlanticand the pacific eastasia by the fecundity and indus triousness of its inhabitants secondly there is no longer ina material sense anything to fight about with the establishment of selfcontained economies in which productionand consumption are geared to one another the scramblefor markets which was a main cause of previous wars hascome to an end while the competition for raw materials isno longer a matter of life and death in any case each of thethree superstates is so vast that it can obtain almost all thematerials that it needs within its own boundaries in so faras the war has a direct economic purpose it is a war for labour power between the frontiers of the superstates andnot permanently in the possession of any of them there liesa rough quadrilateral with its corners at tangier brazzaville darwin and hong kong containing within it abouta fifth of the population of the earth it is for the possession of these thicklypopulated regions and of the northern2361984icecap that the three powers are constantly struggling inpractice no one power ever controls the whole of the disputed area portions of it are constantly changing hands andit is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that dictates the endless changes ofalignmentall of the disputed territories contain valuable mineralsand some of them yield important vegetable products suchas rubber which in colder climates it is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methods but above allthey contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour whichever power controls equatorial africa or the countriesof the middle east or southern india or the indonesianarchipelago disposes also of the bodies of scores or hundreds of millions of illpaid and hardworking coolies theinhabitants of these areas reduced more or less openly tothe status of slaves pass continually from conqueror to conqueror and are expended like so much coal or oil in therace to turn out more armaments to capture more territoryto control more labour power to turn out more armamentsto capture more territory and so on indefinitely it shouldbe noted that the fighting never really moves beyond theedges of the disputed areas the frontiers of eurasia flowback and forth between the basin of the congo and thenorthern shore of the mediterranean the islands of the indian ocean and the pacific are constantly being capturedand recaptured by oceania or by eastasia in mongolia thedividing line between eurasia and eastasia is never stableround the pole all three powers lay claim to enormous terrifree ebooks at planet ebookcom237tories which in fact are largely unihabited and unexploredbut the balance of power always remains roughly even andthe territory which forms the heartland of each superstatealways remains inviolate moreover the labour of the exploited peoples round the equator is not really necessary tothe worlds economy they add nothing to the wealth of theworld since whatever they produce is used for purposes ofwar and the object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which to wage another war by their labourthe slave populations allow the tempo of continuous warfare to be speeded up but if they did not exist the structureof world society and the process by which it maintains itself would not be essentially differentthe primary aim of modern warfare in accordancewith the principles of doublethink this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directingbrains of the inner party is to use up the products of themachine without raising the general standard of livingever since the end of the nineteenth century the problem ofwhat to do with the surplus of consumption goods has beenlatent in industrial society at present when few human beings even have enough to eat this problem is obviously noturgent and it might not have become so even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work the worldof today is a bare hungry dilapidated place compared withthe world that existed before 1914 and still more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of thatperiod looked forward in the early twentieth century thevision of a future society unbelievably rich leisured orderly2381984and efficient—a glittering antiseptic world of glass and steeland snowwhite concrete—was part of the consciousness ofnearly every literate person science and technology weredeveloping at a prodigious speed and it seemed natural toassume that they would go on developing this failed tohappen partly because of the impoverishment caused by along series of wars and revolutions partly because scientificand technical progress depended on the empirical habit ofthought which could not survive in a strictly regimentedsociety as a whole the world is more primitive today than itwas fifty years ago certain backward areas have advancedand various devices always in some way connected withwarfare and police espionage have been developed butexperiment and invention have largely stopped and theravages of the atomic war of the nineteenfifties have never been fully repaired nevertheless the dangers inherentin the machine are still there from the moment when themachine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery and thereforeto a great extent for human inequality had disappeared ifthe machine were used deliberately for that end hungeroverwork dirt illiteracy and disease could be eliminatedwithin a few generations and in fact without being usedfor any such purpose but by a sort of automatic process—by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible notto distribute—the machine did raise the living standardsof the average humand being very greatly over a period ofabout fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuriesfree ebooks at planet ebookcom239but it was also clear that an allround increase in wealththreatened the destruction—indeed in some sense was thedestruction—of a hierarchical society in a world in whicheveryone worked short hours had enough to eat lived in ahouse with a bathroom and a refrigerator and possessed amotorcar or even an aeroplane the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would alreadyhave disappeared if it once became general wealth wouldconfer no distinction it was possible no doubt to imaginea society in which wealth in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries should be evenly distributed whilepower remained in the hands of a small privileged castebut in practice such a society could not long remain stable for if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike thegreat mass of human beings who are normally stupefied bypoverty would become literate and would learn to think forthemselves and when once they had done this they wouldsooner or later realize that the privileged minority had nofunction and they would sweep it away in the long runa hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance to return to the agricultural past assome thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing was not a practicable solution itconflicted with the tendency towards mechanization whichhad become quasiinstinctive throughout almost the wholeworld and moreover any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and wasbound to be dominated directly or indirectly by its moreadvanced rivals2401984nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses inpoverty by restricting the output of goods this happenedto a great extent during the final phase of capitalism roughly between 1920 and 1940 the economy of many countrieswas allowed to stagnate land went out of cultivation capitalequipment was not added to great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive bystate charity but this too entailed military weakness andsince the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary it made opposition inevitable the problem was howto keep the wheels of industry turning without increasingthe real wealth of the world goods must be produced butthey must not be distributed and in practice the only wayof achieving this was by continuous warfarethe essential act of war is destruction not necessarily ofhuman lives but of the products of human labour war is away of shattering to pieces or pouring into the stratosphereor sinking in the depths of the sea materials which mightotherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable andhence in the long run too intelligent even when weaponsof war are not actually destroyed their manufacture is stilla convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed a floating fortressfor example has locked up in it the labour that would buildseveral hundred cargoships ultimately it is scrapped asobsolete never having brought any material benefit to anybody and with further enormous labours another floatingfortress is built in principle the war effort is always soplanned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meetfree ebooks at planet ebookcom241ing the bare needs of the population in practice the needsof the population are always underestimated with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessitiesof life but this is looked on as an advantage it is deliberatepolicy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere nearthe brink of hardship because a general state of scarcityincreases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another bythe standards of the early twentieth century even a member of the inner party lives an austere laborious kind of lifenevertheless the few luxuries that he does enjoy his largewellappointed flat the better texture of his clothes the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco his two orthree servants his private motorcar or helicopter—set himin a different world from a member of the outer party andthe members of the outer party have a similar advantagein comparison with the submerged masses whom we callthe proles the social atmosphere is that of a besieged citywhere the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty and at the same timethe consciousness of being at war and therefore in dangermakes the handingover of all power to a small caste seemthe natural unavoidable condition of survivalwar it will be seen accomplishes the necessary destruction but accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable wayin principle it would be quite simple to waste the surpluslabour of the world by building temples and pyramids bydigging holes and filling them up again or even by producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them2421984but this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society what is concernedhere is not the morale of masses whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work but themorale of the party itself even the humblest party memberis expected to be competent industrious and even intelligent within narrow limits but it is also necessary that heshould be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailingmoods are fear hatred adulation and orgiastic triumph inother words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to a state of war it does not matter whetherthe war is actually happening and since no decisive victoryis possible it does not matter whether the war is going wellor badly all that is needed is that a state of war should exist the splitting of the intelligence which the party requiresof its members and which is more easily achieved in an atmosphere of war is now almost universal but the higherup the ranks one goes the more marked it becomes it isprecisely in the inner party that war hysteria and hatred ofthe enemy are strongest in his capacity as an administrator it is often necessary for a member of the inner party toknow that this or that item of war news is untruthful andhe may often be aware that the entire war is spurious and iseither not happening or is being waged for purposes quiteother than the declared ones but such knowledge is easilyneutralized by the technique of doublethink meanwhile no inner party member wavers for an instant in hismystical belief that the war is real and that it is bound toend victoriously with oceania the undisputed master offree ebooks at planet ebookcom243the entire worldall members of the inner party believe in this comingconquest as an article of faith it is to be achieved either bygradually acquiring more and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of power or bythe discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon thesearch for new weapons continues unceasingly and is oneof the very few remaining activities in which the inventiveor speculative type of mind can find any outlet in oceania at the present day science in the old sense has almostceased to exist in newspeak there is no word for sciencethe empirical method of thought on which all the scientific achievements of the past were founded is opposed tothe most fundamental principles of ingsoc and even technological progress only happens when its products can insome way be used for the diminution of human liberty inall the useful arts the world is either standing still or going backwards the fields are cultivated with horseploughswhile books are written by machinery but in matters ofvital importance—meaning in effect war and police espionage—the empirical approach is still encouraged or at leasttolerated the two aims of the party are to conquer the wholesurface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all thepossibility of independent thought there are therefore twogreat problems which the party is concerned to solve oneis how to discover against his will what another human being is thinking and the other is how to kill several hundredmillion people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand in so far as scientific research still continues this2441984is its subject matter the scientist of today is either a mixtureof psychologist and inquisitor studying with real ordinaryminuteness the meaning of facial expressions gestures andtones of voice and testing the truthproducing effects ofdrugs shock therapy hypnosis and physical torture or heis chemist physicist or biologist concerned only with suchbranches of his special subject as are relevant to the takingof life in the vast laboratories of the ministry of peace andin the experimental stations hidden in the brazilian forestsor in the australian desert or on lost islands of the antarctic the teams of experts are indefatigably at work someare concerned simply with planning the logistics of futurewars others devise larger and larger rocket bombs moreand more powerful explosives and more and more impenetrable armourplating others search for new and deadliergases or for soluble poisons capable of being produced insuch quantities as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents or for breeds of disease germs immunized againstall possible antibodies others strive to produce a vehiclethat shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under the water or an aeroplane as independent of its baseas a sailingship others explore even remoter possibilitiessuch as focusing the suns rays through lenses suspendedthousands of kilometres away in space or producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at theearths centrebut none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization and none of the three superstates ever gains asignificant lead on the others what is more remarkable isfree ebooks at planet ebookcom245that all three powers already possess in the atomic bomba weapon far more powerful than any that their presentresearches are likely to discover although the party according to its habit claims the invention for itself atomicbombs first appeared as early as the nineteenforties andwere first used on a large scale about ten years later at thattime some hundreds of bombs were dropped on industrial centres chiefly in european russia western europeand north america the effect was to convince the rulinggroups of all countries that a few more atomic bombs wouldmean the end of organized society and hence of their ownpower thereafter although no formal agreement was evermade or hinted at no more bombs were dropped all threepowers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and storethem up against the decisive opportunity which they allbelieve will come sooner or later and meanwhile the artof war has remained almost stationary for thirty or fortyyears helicopters are more used than they were formerlybombing planes have been largely superseded by selfpropelled projectiles and the fragile movable battleship hasgiven way to the almost unsinkable floating fortress butotherwise there has been little development the tank thesubmarine the torpedo the machine gun even the rifle andthe hand grenade are still in use and in spite of the endless slaughters reported in the press and on the telescreensthe desperate battles of earlier wars in which hundreds ofthousands or even millions of men were often killed in afew weeks have never been repeatednone of the three superstates ever attempts any ma2461984noeuvre which involves the risk of serious defeat whenany large operation is undertaken it is usually a surpriseattack against an ally the strategy that all three powers arefollowing or pretend to themselves that they are followingis the same the plan is by a combination of fighting bargaining and welltimed strokes of treachery to acquire aring of bases completely encircling one or other of the rival states and then to sign a pact of friendship with thatrival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years as tolull suspicion to sleep during this time rockets loaded withatomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spotsfinally they will all be fired simultaneously with effects sodevastating as to make retaliation impossible it will then betime to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining worldpower in preparation for another attack this scheme it ishardly necessary to say is a mere daydream impossible ofrealization moreover no fighting ever occurs except in thedisputed areas round the equator and the pole no invasionof enemy territory is ever undertaken this explains the factthat in some places the frontiers between the superstatesare arbitrary eurasia for example could easily conquer thebritish isles which are geographically part of europe or onthe other hand it would be possible for oceania to push itsfrontiers to the rhine or even to the vistula but this wouldviolate the principle followed on all sides though neverformulated of cultural integrity if oceania were to conquer the areas that used once to be known as france andgermany it would be necessary either to exterminate theinhabitants a task of great physical difficulty or to assimifree ebooks at planet ebookcom247late a population of about a hundred million people whoso far as technical development goes are roughly on theoceanic level the problem is the same for all three superstates it is absolutely necessary to their structure that thereshould be no contact with foreigners except to a limitedextent with war prisoners and coloured slaves even the official ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkestsuspicion war prisoners apart the average citizen of oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either eurasia or eastasiaand he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages ifhe were allowed contact with foreigners he would discoverthat they are creatures similar to himself and that most ofwhat he has been told about them is lies the sealed worldin which he lives would be broken and the fear hatredand selfrighteousness on which his morale depends mightevaporate it is therefore realized on all sides that howeveroften persia or egypt or java or ceylon may change handsthe main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except bombsunder this lies a fact never mentioned aloud but tacitlyunderstood and acted upon namely that the conditions oflife in all three superstates are very much the same in oceania the prevailing philosophy is called ingsoc in eurasiait is called neobolshevism and in eastasia it is called bya chinese name usually translated as deathworship butperhaps better rendered as obliteration of the self the citizen of oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenetsof the other two philosophies but he is taught to execratethem as barbarous outrages upon morality and common2481984sense actually the three philosophies are barely distinguishable and the social systems which they support arenot distinguishable at all everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure the same worship of semidivine leaderthe same economy existing by and for continuous warfareit follows that the three superstates not only can not conquer one another but would gain no advantage by doingso on the contrary so long as they remain in conflict theyprop one another up like three sheaves of corn and asusual the ruling groups of all three powers are simultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing their livesare dedicated to world conquest but they also know that itis necessary that the war should continue everlastingly andwithout victory meanwhile the fact that there is no dangerof conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is thespecial feature of ingsoc and its rival systems of thoughthere it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier thatby becoming continuous war has fundamentally changedits characterin past ages a war almost by definition was somethingthat sooner or later came to an end usually in unmistakable victory or defeat in the past also war was one of themain instruments by which human societies were kept intouch with physical reality all rulers in all ages have triedto impose a false view of the world upon their followers butthey could not afford to encourage any illusion that tendedto impair military efficiency so long as defeat meant theloss of independence or some other result generally heldto be undesirable the precautions against defeat had to befree ebooks at planet ebookcom249serious physical facts could not be ignored in philosophyor religion or ethics or politics two and two might makefive but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane theyhad to make four inefficient nations were always conqueredsooner or later and the struggle for efficiency was inimical to illusions moreover to be efficient it was necessary tobe able to learn from the past which meant having a fairlyaccurate idea of what had happened in the past newspapers and history books were of course always coloured andbiased but falsification of the kind that is practised todaywould have been impossible war was a sure safeguard ofsanity and so far as the ruling classes were concerned it wasprobably the most important of all safeguards while warscould be won or lost no ruling class could be completely irresponsiblebut when war becomes literally continuous it also ceasesto be dangerous when war is continuous there is no suchthing as military necessity technical progress can ceaseand the most palpable facts can be denied or disregardedas we have seen researches that could be called scientificare still carried out for the purposes of war but they are essentially a kind of daydreaming and their failure to showresults is not important efficiency even military efficiencyis no longer needed nothing is efficient in oceania exceptthe thought police since each of the three superstates isunconquerable each is in effect a separate universe withinwhich almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised reality only exerts its pressure through the needs ofeveryday life—the need to eat and drink to get shelter and2501984clothing to avoid swallowing poison or stepping out of topstorey windows and the like between life and death andbetween physical pleasure and physical pain there is stilla distinction but that is all cut off from contact with theouter world and with the past the citizen of oceania islike a man in interstellar space who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down the rulers ofsuch a state are absolute as the pharaohs or the caesarscould not be they are obliged to prevent their followersfrom starving to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient and they are obliged to remain at the samelow level of military technique as their rivals but once thatminimum is achieved they can twist reality into whatevershape they choosethe war therefore if we judge it by the standards of previous wars is merely an imposture it is like the battlesbetween certain ruminant animals whose horns are set atsuch an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another but though it is unreal it is not meaningless it eats upthe surplus of consumable goods and it helps to preservethe special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical societyneeds war it will be seen is now a purely internal affairin the past the ruling groups of all countries althoughthey might recognize their common interest and thereforelimit the destructiveness of war did fight against one another and the victor always plundered the vanquished inour own day they are not fighting against one another atall the war is waged by each ruling group against its ownsubjects and the object of the war is not to make or preventfree ebooks at planet

ceased to exist the peculiar pressurethat it exerted on human beings between the neolithic ageand the early twentieth century has disappeared and beenreplaced by something quite different the effect would bemuch the same if the three superstates instead of fightingone another should agree to live in perpetual peace eachinviolate within its own boundaries for in that case eachwould still be a selfcontained universe freed for ever fromthe sobering influence of external danger a peace that wastruly permanent would be the same as a permanent warthis—although the vast majority of party members

the low they havebeen subdivided in many ways they have borne countless different names and their relative numbers as well astheir attitude towards one another have varied from age toage but the essential structure of society has never alteredeven after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocablechanges the same pattern has always reasserted itself justas a gyroscope will always return to equilibnum howeverfar it is pushed one way or the otherjulia are you awake said winstonyes my love im listening go on its marvelloushe continued readingthe aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable the aim of the high is to remain where they are theaim of the middle is to change places with the high theaim of the low when they have an aim—for it is an abidingcharacteristic of the low that they are too much crushedby drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious ofanything outside their daily lives—is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equalthus throughout history a struggle which is the same in itsmain outlines recurs over and over again for long periodsthe high seem to be securely in power but sooner or later2541984there always comes a moment when they lose either theirbelief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficientlyor both they are then overthrown by the middle who enlist the low on their side by pretending to them that theyare fighting for liberty and justice as soon as they havereached their objective the middle thrust the low backinto their old position of servitude and themselves becomethe high presently a new middle group splits off from oneof the other groups or from both of them and the strugglebegins over again of the three groups only the low arenever even temporarily successful in achieving their aimsit would be an exaggeration to say that throughout historythere has been no progress of a material kind even todayin a period of decline the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago but no advancein wealth no softening of manners no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearerfrom the point of view of the low no historic change hasever meant much more than a change in the name of theirmastersby the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had become obvious to many observers there thenrose schools of thinkers who interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that inequality was theunalterable law of human life this doctrine of course hadalways had its adherents but in the manner in which it wasnow put forward there was a significant change in the pastthe need for a hierarchical form of society had been the doctrine specifically of the high it had been preached by kingsfree ebooks at planet ebookcom255and aristocrats and by the priests lawyers and the like whowere parasitical upon them and it had generally been softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary worldbeyond the grave the middle so long as it was strugglingfor power had always made use of such terms as freedomjustice and fraternity now however the concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who werenot yet in positions of command but merely hoped to be sobefore long in the past the middle had made revolutionsunder the banner of equality and then had established afresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown thenew middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand socialism a theory which appeared in the earlynineteenth century and was the last link in a chain ofthought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquitywas still deeply infected by the utopianism of past ages butin each variant of socialism that appeared from about 1900onwards the aim of establishing liberty and equality wasmore and more openly abandoned the new movementswhich appeared in the middle years of the century ingsocin oceania neobolshevism in eurasia deathworship asit is commonly called in eastasia had the conscious aimof perpetuating unfreedom and inequality these newmovements of course grew out of the old ones and tendedto keep their names and pay lipservice to their ideologybut the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress andfreeze history at a chosen moment the familiar pendulumswing was to happen once more and then stop as usualthe high were to be turned out by the middle who would2561984then become the high but this time by conscious strategythe high would be able to maintain their position permanentlythe new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historical knowledge and the growth of thehistorical sense which had hardly existed before the nineteenth century the cyclical movement of history was nowintelligible or appeared to be so and if it was intelligiblethen it was alterable but the principal underlying causewas that as early as the beginning of the twentieth centuryhuman equality had become technically possible it was stilltrue that men were not equal in their native talents and thatfunctions had to be specialized in ways that favoured someindividuals against others but there was no longer any realneed for class distinctions or for large differences of wealthin earlier ages class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable inequality was the price of civilizationwith the development of machine production however thecase was altered even if it was still necessary for humanbeings to do different kinds of work it was no longer necessary for them to live at different social or economic levelstherefore from the point of view of the new groups whowere on the point of seizing power human equality was nolonger an ideal to be striven after but a danger to be averted in more primitive ages when a just and peaceful societywas in fact not possible it had been fairly easy to believe itthe idea of an earthly paradise in which men should livetogether in a state of brotherhood without laws and without brute labour had haunted the human imagination forfree ebooks at planet ebookcom257thousands of years and this vision had had a certain holdeven on the groups who actually profited by each historical change the heirs of the french english and americanrevolutions had partly believed in their own phrases aboutthe rights of man freedom of speech equality before thelaw and the like and have even allowed their conduct tobe influenced by them to some extent but by the fourthdecade of the twentieth century all the main currents ofpolitical thought were authoritarian the earthly paradisehad been discredited at exactly the moment when it becamerealizable every new political theory by whatever name itcalled itself led back to hierarchy and regimentation andin the general hardening of outlook that set in round about1930 practices which had been long abandoned in somecases for hundreds of years—imprisonment without trialthe use of war prisoners as slaves public executions tortureto extract confessions the use of hostages and the deportation of whole populations—not only became commonagain but were tolerated and even defended by people whoconsidered themselves enlightened and progressiveit was only after a decade of national wars civil warsrevolutions and counterrevolutions in all parts of theworld that ingsoc and its rivals emerged as fully workedout political theories but they had been foreshadowed bythe various systems generally called totalitarian whichhad appeared earlier in the century and the main outlinesof the world which would emerge from the prevailing chaoshad long been obvious what kind of people would controlthis world had been equally obvious the new aristocracy2581984was made up for the most part of bureaucrats scientiststechnicians tradeunion organizers publicity experts sociologists teachers journalists and professional politiciansthese people whose origins lay in the salaried middle classand the upper grades of the working class had been shapedand brought together by the barren world of monopoly industry and centralized government as compared withtheir opposite numbers in past ages they were less avaricious less tempted by luxury hungrier for pure power andabove all more conscious of what they were doing andmore intent on crushing opposition this last difference wascardinal by comparison with that existing today all thetyrannies of the past were halfhearted and inefficient theruling groups were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas and were content to leave loose ends everywhereto regard only the overt act and to be uninterested in whattheir subjects were thinking even the catholic church ofthe middle ages was tolerant by modern standards part ofthe reason for this was that in the past no government hadthe power to keep its citizens under constant surveillancethe invention of print however made it easier to manipulate public opinion and the film and the radio carried theprocess further with the development of television andthe technical advance which made it possible to receive andtransmit simultaneously on the same instrument privatelife came to an end every citizen or at least every citizenimportant enough to be worth watching could be kept fortwentyfour hours a day under the eyes of the police and inthe sound of official propaganda with all other channelsfree ebooks at planet ebookcom259of communication closed the possibility of enforcing notonly complete obedience to the will of the state but complete uniformity of opinion on all subjects now existed forthe first timeafter the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixtiessociety regrouped itself as always into high middle andlow but the new high group unlike all its forerunners didnot act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguardits position it had long been realized that the only securebasis for oligarchy is collectivism wealth and privilege aremost easily defended when they are possessed jointly thesocalled abolition of private property which took place inthe middle years of the century meant in effect the concentration of property in far fewer hands than before butwith this difference that the new owners were a group instead of a mass of individuals individually no member ofthe party owns anything except petty personal belongingscollectively the party owns everything in oceania because it controls everything and disposes of the productsas it thinks fit in the years following the revolution it wasable to step into this commanding position almost unopposed because the whole process was represented as an actof collectivization it had always been assumed that if thecapitalist class were expropriated socialism must followand unquestionably the capitalists had been expropriatedfactories mines land houses transport—everything hadbeen taken away from them and since these things wereno longer private property it followed that they must bepublic property ingsoc which grew out of the earlier so2601984cialist movement and inherited its phraseology has in factcarried out the main item in the socialist programme withthe result foreseen and intended beforehand that economic inequality has been made permanentbut the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than this there are only four ways in whicha ruling group can fall from power either it is conqueredfrom without or it governs so inefficiently that the massesare stirred to revolt or it allows a strong and discontentedmiddle group to come into being or it loses its own selfconfidence and willingness to govern these causes do notoperate singly and as a rule all four of them are present insome degree a ruling class which could guard against allof them would remain in power permanently ultimatelythe determining factor is the mental attitude of the rulingclass itselfafter the middle of the present century the first danger had in reality disappeared each of the three powerswhich now divide the world is in fact unconquerable andcould only become conquerable through slow demographicchanges which a government with wide powers can easily avert the second danger also is only a theoretical onethe masses never revolt of their own accord and they neverrevolt merely because they are oppressed indeed so longas they are not permitted to have standards of comparisonthey never even become aware that they are oppressed therecurrent economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are not now permitted to happen but otherand equally large dislocations can and do happen withoutfree ebooks at planet ebookcom261having political results because there is no way in whichdiscontent can become articulate as for the problem ofoverproduction which has been latent in our society sincethe development of machine technique it is solved by thedevice of continuous warfare see chapter iii which isalso useful in keying up public morale to the necessarypitch from the point of view of our present rulers therefore the only genuine dangers are the splittingoff of a newgroup of able underemployed powerhungry people andthe growth of liberalism and scepticism in their own ranksthe problem that is to say is educational it is a problemof continuously moulding the consciousness both of thedirecting group and of the larger executive group that liesimmediately below it the consciousness of the massesneeds only to be influenced in a negative waygiven this background one could infer if one did notknow it already the

be reasonably sure that he will never dieand there is already considerable uncertainty as to when hewas born big brother is the guise in which the party chooses to exhibit itself to the world his function is to act as afocusing point for love fear and reverence emotions whichare more easily felt towards an individual than towards an2621984organization below big brother comes the inner party itsnumbers limited to six millions or something less than2 per cent of the population of oceania below the innerparty comes the outer party which if the inner party is described as the brain of the state may be justly likened to thehands below that come the dumb masses whom we habitually refer to as the proles numbering perhaps 85 per cent ofthe population in the terms of our earlier classification theproles are the low for the slave population of the equatorial lands who pass constantly from conqueror to conquerorare not a permanent or necessary part of the structurein principle membership of these three groups is not hereditary the child of inner party parents is in theory notborn into the inner party admission to either branch of theparty is by examination taken at the age

any way its rulers are not held togetherby bloodties but by adherence to a common doctrine itis true that our society is stratified and very rigidly stratified on what at first sight appear to be hereditary linesfree ebooks at planet ebookcom263there is far less toandfro movement between the different groups than happened under capitalism or even in thepreindustrial age between the two branches of the partythere is a certain amount of interchange but only so muchas will ensure that weaklings are excluded from the innerparty and that ambitious members of the outer party aremade harmless by allowing them to rise proletarians inpractice are not allowed to graduate into the party themost gifted among them who might possibly become nuclei of discontent are simply marked down by the thoughtpolice and eliminated but this state of affairs is not necessarily permanent nor is it a matter of principle the partyis not a class in the old sense of the word it does not aimat transmitting power to its own children as such and ifthere were no other way of keeping the ablest people at thetop it would be perfectly prepared to recruit an entire newgeneration from the ranks of the proletariat in the crucialyears the fact that the party was not a hereditary body dida great deal to neutralize opposition the older kind of socialist who had been trained to fight against somethingcalled class privilege assumed that what is not hereditarycannot be permanent he did not see that the continuityof an oligarchy need not be physical nor did he pause toreflect that hereditary aristocracies have always been shortlived whereas adoptive organizations such as the catholicchurch have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousandsof years the essence of oligarchical rule is not fathertosoninheritance but the persistence of a certain worldview anda certain way of life imposed by the dead upon the living a2641984ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate

not inflicted as punishment for crimes which have actually been committed but are merely the wipingout ofpersons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time inthe future a party member is required to have not only theright opinions but the right instincts many of the beliefsand attitudes demanded of him are never plainly stated andcould not be stated without laying bare the

by such devices as the two minuteshate and the speculations which might possibly induce asceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by hisearly acquired inner discipline the first and

dangerous thought it includes thepower of not grasping analogies of failing to perceive logical errors of misunderstanding the simplest arguments ifthey are inimical to ingsoc and of being bored or repelledby any train of thought which is capable of leading in aheretical direction crimestop in short means protective stupidity but stupidity is not enough on the contraryorthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over onesown mental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body oceanic society rests ultimately on thebelief that big brother is omnipotent and that the party isinfallible but since in reality big brother is not omnipotentand the party is not infallible there is need for an unwearying momenttomoment flexibility in the treatment offacts the keyword here is blackwhite like so manyfree ebooks at planet ebookcom267newspeak words this word has two mutually contradictory meanings applied to an opponent it means the habit ofimpudently claiming that black is white in contradiction ofthe plain facts applied to a party member it means a loyalwillingness to say that black is white when party disciplinedemands this but it means also the ability to believe thatblack is white and more to know that black is white andto forget that one has ever believed the contrary this demands a continuous alteration of the past made possibleby the system of thought which really embraces all the restand which is known in newspeak as doublethinkthe alteration of the past is necessary for two reasonsone of which is subsidiary and so to speak precautionary the subsidiary reason is that the party member likethe proletarian tolerates presentday conditions partly because he has no standards of comparison he must be cutoff from the past just as he must be cut off from foreigncountries because it is necessary for him to believe thathe is better off than his ancestors and that the average level of material comfort is constantly rising but by far themore important reason for the readjustment of the past isthe need to safeguard the infallibility of the party it is notmerely that speeches statistics and records of every kindmust be constantly brought up to date in order to show thatthe predictions of the party were in all cases right it is alsothat no change in doctrine or in political alignment canever be admitted for to change ones mind or even onespolicy is a confession of weakness if for example eurasiaor eastasia whichever it may be is the enemy today then2681984that country must always have been the enemy and if thefacts say otherwise then the facts must be altered thus history is continuously rewritten this daytoday falsificationof the past carried out by the ministry of truth is as necessary to the stability of the regime as the work of repressionand espionage carried out by the ministry of lovethe mutability of the past is the central tenet of ingsocpast events it is argued have no objective existence butsurvive only in written records and in human memoriesthe past is whatever the records and the memories agreeupon and since the party is in full control of all recordsand in equally full control of the minds of its members itfollows that the past is whatever the party chooses to makeit it also follows that though the past is alterable it neverhas been altered in any specific instance for when it hasbeen recreated in whatever shape is needed at the momentthen this new version is the past and no different past canever have existed this holds good even when as often happens the same event has to be altered out of recognitionseveral times in the course of a year at all times the partyis in possession of absolute truth and clearly the absolutecan never have been different from what it is now it willbe seen that the control of the past depends above all onthe training of memory to make sure that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merelya mechanical act but it is also necessary to rememberthat events happened in the desired manner and if it isnecessary to rearrange ones memories or to tamper withwritten records then it is necessary to forget that onefree ebooks at planet ebookcom269has done so the trick of doing this can be learned like anyother mental technique it is learned by the majority of party members and certainly by all who are intelligent as wellas orthodox in oldspeak it is called quite frankly realitycontrol in newspeak it is called doublethink thoughdoublethink comprises much else as welldoublethink means the power of holding twocontradictory beliefs in ones mind simultaneously and accepting both of them the party intellectual knows in whichdirection his memories must be altered he therefore knowsthat he is playing tricks with reality but by the exercise ofdoublethink he also satisfies himself that reality is notviolated the process has to be conscious or it would notbe carried out with sufficient precision but it also has to beunconscious or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity andhence of guilt doublethink lies at the very heart of ingsoc since the essential act of the party is to use consciousdeception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goeswith complete honesty to tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them to forget any fact that has becomeinconvenient and then when it becomes necessary againto draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is neededto deny the existence of objective reality and all the whileto take account of the reality which one denies—all this isindispensably necessary even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink forby using the word one admits that one is tampering withreality by a fresh act of doublethink one erases thisknowledge and so on indefinitely with the lie always one2701984leap ahead of the truth ultimately it is by means of doublethink that the party has been able—and may for allwe know continue to be able for thousands of years—to arrest the course of historyall past oligarchies have fallen from power either becausethey ossified or because they grew soft either they becamestupid and arrogant failed to adjust themselves to changing circumstances and were overthrown or they becameliberal and cowardly made concessions when they shouldhave used force and once again were overthrown they fellthat is to say either through consciousness or through unconsciousness it is the achievement of the party to haveproduced a system of thought in which both conditions canexist simultaneously and upon no other intellectual basiscould the dominion of the party be made permanent if oneis to rule and to continue ruling one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality for the secret of rulership is tocombine a belief in ones own infallibility with the power tolearn from past mistakesit need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners ofdoublethink are those who invented doublethinkand know that it is a vast system of mental cheating inour society those who have the best knowledge of what ishappening are also those who are furthest from seeing theworld as it is in general the greater the understanding thegreater the delusion the more intelligent the less sane oneclear illustration of this is the fact that war hysteria increases in intensity as one rises in the social scale those whoseattitude towards the war is most nearly rational are the subfree ebooks at planet ebookcom271ject peoples of the disputed territories to these people thewar is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to andfro over their bodies like a tidal wave which side is winning is a matter of complete indifference to them they areaware that a change of overlordship means simply that theywill be doing the same work as before for new masters whotreat them in the same manner as the old ones the slightlymore favoured workers whom we call the proles are onlyintermittently conscious of the war when it is necessarythey can be prodded into frenzies of fear and hatred butwhen left to themselves they are capable of forgetting forlong periods that the war is happening it is in the ranks ofthe party and above all of the inner party that the true warenthusiasm is found worldconquest is believed in mostfirmly by those who know it to be impossible this peculiarlinkingtogether of opposites—knowledge with ignorancecynicism with fanaticism—is one of the chief distinguishing marks of oceanic society the official ideology aboundswith contradictions even when there is no practical reasonfor them thus the party rejects and vilifies every principlefor which the socialist movement originally stood and itchooses to do this in the name of socialism it preaches acontempt for the working class unexampled for centuriespast and it dresses its members in a uniform which was atone time peculiar to manual workers and was adopted forthat reason it systematically undermines the solidarity ofthe family and it calls its leader by a name which is a directappeal to the sentiment of family loyalty even the names ofthe four ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort2721984of impudence in their deliberate reversal of the facts theministry of peace concerns itself with war the ministry oftruth with lies the ministry of love with torture and theministry of plenty with starvation these contradictionsare not accidental nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy they are deliberate exercises in doublethink forit is only by reconciling contradictions that power can beretained indefinitely in no other way could the ancient cycle be broken if human equality is to be for ever averted—ifthe high as we have called them are to keep their placespermanently—then the prevailing mental condition mustbe controlled insanitybut there is one question which until this moment wehave almost ignored it is why should human equality beaverted supposing that the mechanics of the process havebeen rightly described what is the motive for this hugeaccurately planned effort to freeze history at a particularmoment of timehere we reach the central secret as we have seen themystique of the party and above all of the inner party depends upon doublethink but deeper than this lies theoriginal motive the neverquestioned instinct that first ledto the seizure of power and brought doublethink

aspect of the pale cloudless sky stretching away behindthe chimneypots into interminable distance it was curious to think that the sky was the same for everybody ineurasia or eastasia as well as here and the people underthe sky were also very much the same—everywhere all overthe world hundreds of thousands of millions of people justlike this people ignorant of one anothers existence heldapart by walls of hatred and lies and yet almost exactly thesame—people who had never learned to think but who werestoring up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the powerthat would one day overturn the

their time came the world they constructed would notbe just as alien to him winston smith as the world of theparty yes because at the least it would be a world of sanitywhere there is equality there

vitality which the party did not share and could not killdo you remember he said the thrush that sang to usthat first day at the edge of the woodhe wasnt singing to us said julia he was singing

monstrous by work and childbearing toilingfrom birth to death and still singing out of those mightyloins a race of conscious beings must one day come youwere the dead theirs was the future but you could share inthat future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive thebody and passed on the secret doctrine that two plus twomake fourwe are the dead he saidwe are the dead echoed julia dutifullyyou are the dead said an iron voice behind themthey sprang apart winstons entrails seemed to haveturned into ice he could see the white all round the irises of2781984julias eyes her face had turned a milky yellow the smearof rouge that was still on each cheekbone stood out sharplyalmost as though unconnected with the skin beneathyou are the dead repeated the iron voiceit was behind the picture breathed juliait was behind the picture said the voice remain exactlywhere you are make no movement until you are orderedit was starting it was starting at last they could do nothing except stand gazing into one anothers eyes to run forlife to get out of the house before it was too late—no suchthought occurred to them unthinkable to disobey the ironvoice from the wall there was a snap as though a catch hadbeen turned back and a crash of breaking glass the picturehad fallen to the floor uncovering the telescreen behind itnow they can see us said julianow we can see you said the voice stand out in themiddle of the room stand back to back clasp your handsbehind your heads do not touch one anotherthey were not touching but it seemed to him that hecould feel julias body shaking or perhaps it was merelythe shaking of his own he could just stop his teeth fromchattering but his knees were beyond his control therewas a sound of trampling boots below inside the house andoutside the yard seemed to be full of men something wasbeing dragged across the stones the womans singing hadstopped abruptly there was a long rolling clang as thoughthe washtub had been flung across the yard and then a confusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of painthe house is surrounded said winstonfree ebooks at planet ebookcom279the house is surrounded said the voicehe heard julia snap her teeth together i suppose we mayas well say goodbye she saidyou may as well say goodbye said the voice and thenanother quite different voice a thin cultivated voice whichwinston had the impression of having heard before struckin and by the way while we are on the subject here comesa candle to light you to bed here comes a chopper to chopoff your headsomething crashed on to the bed behind winstons backthe head of a ladder had been thrust through the windowand had burst in the frame someone was climbing throughthe window there was a stampede of boots up the stairsthe room was full of solid men in black uniforms with ironshod boots on their feet and truncheons in their handswinston was not trembling any longer even his eyes hebarely moved one thing alone mattered to keep still tokeep still and not give them an excuse to hit you a manwith a smooth prizefighters jowl in which the mouth wasonly a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheonmeditatively between thumb and forefinger winston methis eyes the feeling of nakedness with ones hands behindones head and ones face and body all exposed was almostunbearable the man protruded the tip of a white tonguelicked the place where his lips should have been and thenpassed on there was another crash someone had pickedup the glass paperweight from the table and smashed it topieces on the hearthstonethe fragment of coral a tiny crinkle of pink like a sug2801984ar rosebud from a cake rolled across the mat how smallthought winston how small it always was there was a gaspand a thump behind him and he received a violent kick onthe ankle which nearly flung him off his balance one of themen had smashed his fist into julias solar plexus doublingher up like a pocket ruler she was thrashing about on thefloor fighting for breath winston dared not turn his headeven by a millimetre but sometimes her livid gasping facecame within the angle of his vision even in his terror it wasas though he could feel the pain in his own body the deadlypain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle toget back her breath he knew what it was like the terribleagonizing pain which was there all the while but could notbe suffered yet because before all else it was necessary tobe able to breathe then two of the men hoisted her up byknees and shoulders and carried her out of the room like asack winston had a glimpse of her face upside down yellow and contorted with the eyes shut and still with a smearof rouge on either cheek and that was the last he saw ofherhe stood dead still no one had hit him yet thoughtswhich came of their own accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to flit through his mind he wondered whetherthey had got mr charrington he wondered what they haddone to the woman in the yard he noticed that he badly wanted to urinate and felt a faint surprise because hehad done so only two or three hours ago he noticed thatthe clock on the mantelpiece said nine meaning twentyone but the light seemed too strong would not the lightfree ebooks at planet ebookcom281be fading at twentyone hours on an august evening hewondered whether after all he and julia had mistaken thetime—had slept the clock round and thought it was twentythirty when really it was nought eightthirty on thefollowing morning but he did not pursue the thought further it was not interestingthere ws another lighter step in the passage mrcharrington came into the room the demeanour ofthe blackuniformed men suddenly became more subdued something had also changed in mr charringtonsappearance his eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweightpick up those pieces he said sharplya man stooped to obey the cockney accent had disappeared winston suddenly realized whose voice it was thathe had heard a few moments ago on the telescreen mr charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket but his hairwhich had been almost white had turned black also he wasnot wearing his spectacles he gave winston a single sharpglance as though verifying his identity and then paid nomore attention to him he was still recognizable but he wasnot the same person any longer his body had straightenedand seemed to have grown bigger his face had undergoneonly tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a completetransformation the black eyebrows were less bushy thewrinkles were gone the whole lines of the face seemed tohave altered even the nose seemed shorter it was the alertcold face of a man of about fiveandthirty it occurred towinston that for the first time in his life he was looking2821984with knowledge at a member of the thought policefree ebooks at planet ebookcom283part three2841984chapter 1he did not know where he was presumably he was inthe ministry of love but there was no way of making certain he was in a highceilinged windowless cell withwalls of glittering white porcelain concealed lamps flooded it with cold light and there was a low steady hummingsound which he supposed had something to do with theair supply a bench or shelf just wide enough to sit on ranround the wall broken only by the door and at the end opposite the door a lavatory pan with no wooden seat therewere four telescreens one in each wallthere was a dull aching in his belly it had been thereever since they had bundled him into the closed van anddriven him away but he was also hungry with a gnawing unwholesome kind of hunger it might be twentyfourhours since he had eaten it might be thirtysix he still didnot know probably never would know whether it had beenmorning or evening when they arrested him since he wasarrested he had not been fedhe sat as still as he could on the narrow bench with hishands crossed on his knee he had already learned to sitstill if you made unexpected movements they yelled at youfrom the telescreen but the craving for food was growingupon him what he longed for above all was a piece of breadhe had an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in thefree ebooks at planet ebookcom285pocket of his overalls it was even possible—he thought thisbecause from time to time something seemed to tickle hisleg—that there might be a sizeable bit of crust there in theend the temptation to find out overcame his fear he slippeda hand into his pocketsmith yelled a voice from the telescreen 6079 smithw hands out of pockets in the cellshe sat still again his hands crossed on his knee before being brought here he had been taken to another placewhich must have been an ordinary prison or a temporarylockup used by the patrols he did not know how long hehad been there some hours at any rate with no clocks andno daylight it was hard to gauge the time it was a noisy evilsmelling place they had put him into a cell similar to theone he was now in but filthily dirty and at all times crowdedby ten or fifteen people the majority of them were commoncriminals but there were a few political prisoners amongthem he had sat silent against the wall jostled by dirtybodies too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly totake much interest in his surroundings but still noticingthe astonishing difference in demeanour between the partyprisoners and the others the party prisoners were alwayssilent and terrified but the ordinary criminals seemed tocare nothing for anybody they yelled insults at the guardsfought back fiercely when their belongings were impounded wrote obscene words on the floor ate smuggled foodwhich they produced from mysterious hidingplaces in theirclothes and even shouted down the telescreen when it triedto restore order on the other hand some of them seemed2861984to be on good terms with the guards called them by nicknames and tried to wheedle cigarettes through the spyholein the door the guards too treated the common criminalswith a certain forbearance even when they had to handlethem roughly there was much talk about the forcedlabourcamps to which most of the prisoners expected to be sentit was all right in the camps he gathered so long as youhad good contacts and knew the ropes there was briberyfavouritism and racketeering of every kind there was homosexuality and prostitution there was even illicit alcoholdistilled from potatoes the positions of trust were givenonly to the common criminals especially the gangsters andthe murderers who formed a sort of aristocracy all thedirty jobs were done by the politicalsthere was a constant comeandgo of prisoners of everydescription drugpeddlers thieves bandits blackmarketeers drunks prostitutes some of the drunks were soviolent that the other prisoners had to combine to suppress them an enormous wreck of a woman aged aboutsixty with great tumbling breasts and thick coils of whitehair which had come down in her struggles was carried inkicking and shouting by four guards who had hold of herone at each corner they wrenched off the boots with whichshe had been trying to kick them and dumped her downacross winstons lap almost breaking his thighbones thewoman hoisted herself upright and followed them out witha yell of f—— bastards then noticing that she was sitting on something uneven she slid off winstons knees onto the benchfree ebooks at planet ebookcom287beg pardon dearie she said i wouldnt a sat on youonly the buggers put me there they dono ow to treat a ladydo they she paused patted her breast and belched pardon she said i aint meself quiteshe leant forward and vomited copiously on the floorthass better she said leaning back with closed eyesnever keep it down thass what i say get it up while itsfresh on your stomach likeshe revived turned to have another look at winston andseemed immediately to take a fancy to him she put a vastarm round his shoulder and drew him towards her breathing beer and vomit into his facewass your name dearie she saidsmith said winstonsmith said the woman thass funny my names smithtoo why she added sentimentally i might be your mothershe might thought winston be his mother she wasabout the right age and physique and it was probable thatpeople changed somewhat after twenty years in a forcedlabour campno one else had spoken to him to a surprising extentthe ordinary criminals ignored the party prisoners thepolits they called them with a sort of uninterested contempt the party prisoners seemed terrified of speaking toanybody and above all of speaking to one another onlyonce when two party members both women were pressedclose together on the bench he overheard amid the din ofvoices a few hurriedlywhispered words and in particular a2881984reference to something called room oneohone which hedid not understandit might be two or three hours ago that they had broughthim here the dull pain in his belly never went away butsometimes it grew better and sometimes worse and histhoughts expanded or contracted accordingly when itgrew worse he thought only of the pain itself and of his desire for food when it grew better panic took hold of himthere were moments when he foresaw the things that wouldhappen to him with such actuality that his heart gallopedand his breath stopped he felt the smash of truncheons onhis elbows and ironshod boots on his shins he saw himselfgrovelling on the floor screaming for mercy through broken teeth he hardly thought of julia he could not fix hismind on her he loved her and would not betray her butthat was only a fact known as he knew the rules of arithmetic he felt no love for her and he hardly even wonderedwhat was happening to her he thought oftener of obrienwith a flickering hope obrien might know that he hadbeen arrested the brotherhood he had said never tried tosave its members but there was the razor blade they wouldsend the razor blade if they could there would be perhapsfive seconds before the guard could rush into the cell theblade would bite into him with a sort of burning coldnessand even the fingers that held it would be cut to the boneeverything came back to his sick body which shrank trembling from the smallest pain he was not certain that hewould use the razor blade even if he got the chance it wasmore natural to exist from moment to moment acceptingfree ebooks at planet ebookcom289another ten minutes life even with the certainty that therewas torture at the end of itsometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelainbricks in the walls of the cell it should have been easy buthe always lost count at some point or another more often hewondered where he was and what time of day it was at onemoment he felt certain that it was broad daylight outsideand at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness inthis place he knew instinctively the lights would never beturned out it was the place with no darkness he saw nowwhy obrien had seemed to recognize the allusion in theministry of love there were no windows his cell might beat the heart of the building or against its outer wall it mightbe ten floors below ground or thirty above it he movedhimself mentally from place to place and tried to determine by the feeling of his body whether he was perchedhigh in the air or buried deep undergroundthere was a sound of marching boots outside the steeldoor opened with a clang a young officer a trim blackuniformed figure who seemed to glitter all over with polishedleather and whose pale straightfeatured face was like awax mask stepped smartly through the doorway he motioned to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner theywere leading the poet ampleforth shambled into the cellthe door clanged shut againampleforth made one or two uncertain movements fromside to side as though having some idea that there was another door to go out of and then began to wander up anddown the cell he had not yet noticed winstons presence2901984his troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metreabove the level of winstons head he was shoeless largedirty toes were sticking out of the holes in his socks hewas also several days away from a shave a scrubby beardcovered his face to the cheekbones giving him an air ofruffianism that went oddly with his large weak frame andnervous movementswinston roused hirnself a little from his lethargy hemust speak to ampleforth and risk the yell from the telescreen it was even conceivable that ampleforth was thebearer of the razor bladeampleforth he saidthere was no yell from the telescreen ampleforthpaused mildly startled his eyes focused themselves slowlyon winstonah smith he said you toowhat are you in forto tell you the truth— he sat down awkwardly on thebench opposite winston there is only one offence is therenot he saidand have you committed itapparently i havehe put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples fora moment as though trying to remember somethingthese things happen he began vaguely i have beenable to recall one instance—a possible

language for days i had racked my brains there wasno other rhymethe expression on his face changed the annoyancepassed out of it and for a moment he looked almost pleaseda sort of intellectual warmth the joy of the pedant who hasfound out some useless fact shone through the dirt andscrubby hairhas it ever occurred to you he said that the whole history of english poetry has been determined by the fact thatthe english language lacks rhymesno that particular thought had never occurred to winston nor in the circumstances did it strike him as veryimportant or interestingdo you know what time of day it is he saidampleforth looked startled again i had hardly thoughtabout it they arrested me—it could be two days ago—perhaps three his eyes flitted round the walls as though hehalf expected to find a window somewhere there is no difference between night and day in this place i do not seehow one can calculate the timethey talked desultorily for some minutes then withoutapparent reason a yell from the telescreen bade them besilent winston sat quietly his hands crossed ampleforthtoo large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench fidgetedfrom side to side clasping his lank hands first round oneknee then round the other the telescreen barked at him to2921984keep still time passed twenty minutes an hour—it wasdifficult to judge once more there was a sound of bootsoutside winstons entrails contracted soon very soonperhaps in five minutes perhaps now the tramp of bootswould mean that his own turn had comethe door opened the coldfaced young officer steppedinto the cell with a brief movement of the hand he indicated ampleforthroom 101 he saidampleforth marched clumsily out between the guardshis face vaguely perturbed but uncomprehendingwhat seemed like a long time passed the pain

winstonthoughtcrime said parsons almost blubbering thetone of his voice implied at once a complete admission ofhis guilt and a sort of incredulous horror that such a wordcould be applied to himself he paused opposite winstonand began eagerly appealing to him you dont think theyllshoot me do you old chap they dont shoot you if youhavent actually done anything—only thoughts which youcant help i know

one a woman was consigned to room 101and winston noticed seemed to shrivel and turn a different colour when she heard the words a time came when ifit had been morning when he was brought here it would beafternoon or if it had been afternoon then it would be midnight there were six prisoners in the cell men and womenall sat very still opposite winston there sat a man with achinless toothy face exactly like that of some large harmless rodent his fat mottled cheeks were so pouched at thebottom that it was difficult not to believe that he had littlestores of food tucked away there his palegrey eyes flittedtimorously from face to face and turned quickly away againwhen he caught anyones eyethe door opened and another prisoner was brought inwhose appearance sent a momentary chill through winston he was a commonplace meanlooking man whomight have been an engineer or technician of some kindbut what was startling was the emaciation of his face itwas like a skull because of its thinness the mouth and eyeslooked disproportionately large and the eyes seemed filledwith a murderous unappeasable hatred of somebody orsomethingthe man sat down on the bench at a little distance fromwinston winston did not look at him again but the tormented skulllike face was as vivid in his mind as thoughit had been straight in front of his eyes suddenly he realized what was the matter the man was dying of starvationthe same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneouslyto everyone in the cell there was a very faint stirring all2961984the way round the bench the eyes of the chinless man keptflitting towards the skullfaced man then turning guiltilyaway then being dragged back by an irresistible attractionpresently he began to fidget on his seat at last he stood upwaddled clumsily across the cell dug down into the pocketof his overalls and with an abashed air held out a grimypiece of bread to the skullfaced manthere was a furious deafening roar from the telescreenthe chinless man jumped in his tracks the skullfaced manhad quickly thrust his hands behind his back as thoughdemonstrating to all the world that he refused the giftbumstead roared the voice 2713 bumstead j let fallthat piece of breadthe chinless man dropped the piece of bread on thefloorremain standing where you are said the voice face thedoor make no movementthe chinless man obeyed his large pouchy cheeks werequivering uncontrollably the door clanged open as theyoung officer entered and stepped aside there emergedfrom behind him a short stumpy guard with enormousarms and shoulders he took his stand opposite the chinless man and then at a signal from the officer let free afrightful blow with all the weight of his body behind it fullin the chinless mans mouth the force of it seemed almostto knock him clear of the floor his body was flung acrossthe cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatory seatfor a moment he lay as though stunned with dark bloodoozing from his mouth and nose a very faint whimperfree ebooks at planet ebookcom297ing or squeaking which seemed unconscious came out ofhim then he rolled over and raised himself unsteadily onhands and knees amid a stream of blood and saliva thetwo halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouththe prisoners sat very still their hands crossed on theirknees the chinless man climbed back into his place downone side of his face the flesh was darkening his mouth hadswollen into a shapeless cherrycoloured mass with a blackhole in the middle of itfrom time to time a little blood dripped on to the breastof his overalls his grey eyes still flitted from face to facemore guiltily than ever as though he were trying to discover how much the others despised him for his humiliationthe door opened with a small gesture the officer indicated the skullfaced manroom 101 he saidthere was a gasp and a flurry at winstons side the manhad actually flung himself on his knees on the floor withhis hand clasped togethercomrade officer he cried you dont have to take me tothat place havent i told you everything already what elseis it you want to know theres nothing i wouldnt confessnothing just tell me what it is and ill confess straight offwrite it down and ill sign it—anything not room 101room 101 said the officerthe mans face already very pale turned a colour winston would not have believed possible it was

elseyou want me to give away just say who it is and ill tell youanything you want i dont care who it is or what you do tothem ive got a wife and three children the biggest of themisnt six years old you can take the whole lot of them andcut their throats in front of my eyes and ill stand by andwatch it but not room 101room 101 said the officerthe man looked frantically round at the other prisonersas though with some idea that he could put another victimin his own place his eyes settled on the smashed face of thechinless man he flung out a lean armthats the one you ought to be taking not me he shouted you didnt hear what he was saying after they bashedhis face give me a chance and ill tell you every word of ithes the one thats against the party not me the guardsstepped forward the mans voice rose to a shriek youdidnt hear him he repeated something went wrong withthe telescreen hes the one you want take him not methe two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by thearms but just at this moment he flung himself across thefloor of the cell and grabbed one of the iron legs that supported the bench he had set up a wordless howling like ananimal the guards took hold of him to wrench him loosebut he clung on with astonishing strength for perhapstwenty seconds they were hauling at him the prisoners satquiet their hands crossed on their knees looking straightin front of them the howling stopped the man had nofree ebooks at planet ebookcom299breath left for anything except hanging on then there wasa different kind of cry a kick from a guards boot had broken the fingers of one of his hands they dragged him tohis feetroom 101 said the officerthe man was led out walking unsteadily with headsunken nursing his crushed hand all the fight had goneout of hima long time passed if it had been midnight when theskullfaced man was taken away it was morning if morning it was afternoon winston was alone and had beenalone for hours the pain of sitting on the narrow benchwas such that often he got up and walked about unreprovedby the telescreen the piece of bread still lay where the chinless man had dropped it at the beginning it needed a hardeffort not to look at it but presently hunger gave way tothirst his mouth was sticky and eviltasting the humming sound and the unvarying white light induced a sortof faintness an empty feeling inside his head he would getup because the ache in his bones was no longer bearableand then would sit down again almost at once because hewas too dizzy to make sure of staying on his feet wheneverhis physical sensations were a little under control the terror returned sometimes with a fading hope he thought ofobrien and the razor blade it was thinkable that the razorblade might arrive concealed in his food if he were everfed more dimly he thought of julia somewhere or othershe was suffering perhaps far worse than he she might bescreaming with pain at this moment he thought if i could3001984save julia by doubling my own pain would i do it yes iwould but that was merely an intellectual decision takenbecause he knew that he ought to take it he did not feel itin this place you could not feel anything except pain andforeknowledge of pain besides was it possible when youwere actually suffering it to wish for any reason that yourown pain should increase but that question was not answerable yetthe boots were approaching again the door openedobrien came inwinston started to his feet the shock of the sight haddriven all caution out of him for the first time in manyyears he forgot the presence of the telescreentheyve got you too he criedthey got me a long time ago said obrien with a mildalmost regretful irony he stepped aside from behind himthere emerged a broadchested guard with a long blacktruncheon in his handyou know this winston said obrien dont deceiveyourself you did know it—you have always known ityes he saw now he had always known it but there was notime to think of that all he had eyes for was the truncheonin the guards hand it might fall anywhere on the crownon the tip of the ear on the upper arm on the elbow——the elbow he had slumped to his knees almost paralysed clasping the stricken elbow with his other handeverything had exploded into yellow light inconceivableinconceivable that one blow could cause such pain thelight cleared and he could see the other two looking downfree ebooks at planet ebookcom301at him the guard was laughing at his contortions onequestion at any rate was answered never for any reasonon earth could you wish for an increase of pain of painyou could wish only one thing that it should stop nothingin the world was so bad as physical pain in the face of painthere are no heroes no heroes he thought over and over ashe writhed on the floor clutching uselessly at his disabledleft arm3021984chapter 2he was lying on something that felt like a camp bed except that it was higher off the ground and that he wasfixed down in some way so that he could not move lightthat seemed stronger than usual was falling on his faceobrien was standing at his side looking down at him intently at the other side of him stood a man in a white coatholding a hypodermic syringeeven after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only gradually he had the impression of swimming upinto this room from some quite different world a sort of underwater world far beneath it how long he had been downthere he did not know since the moment when they arrested him he had not seen darkness or daylight besides hismemories were not continuous there had been times whenconsciousness even the sort of consciousness that one hasin sleep had stopped dead and started again after a blankinterval but whether the intervals were of days or weeks oronly seconds there was no way of knowingwith that first blow on the elbow the nightmare hadstarted later he was to realize that all that then happenedwas merely a preliminary a routine interrogation to whichnearly all prisoners were subjected there was a long rangeof crimes—espionage sabotage and the like—to which everyone had to confess as a matter of course the confessionfree ebooks at planet ebookcom303was a formality though the torture was real how manytimes he had been beaten how long the beatings had continued he could not remember always there were five orsix men in black uniforms at him simultaneously sometimes it was fists sometimes it was truncheons sometimesit was steel rods sometimes it was boots there were timeswhen he rolled about the floor as shameless as an animalwrithing his body this way and that in an endless hopelesseffort to dodge the kicks and simply inviting more and yetmore kicks in his ribs in his belly on his elbows on hisshins in his groin in his testicles on the bone at the baseof his spine there were times when it went on and on until the cruel wicked unforgivable thing seemed to him notthat the guards continued to beat him but that he could notforce hirnself into losing consciousness there were timeswhen his nerve so forsook him that he began shouting formercy even before the beating began when the mere sightof a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make himpour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes therewere other times when he started out with the resolve ofconfessing nothing when every word had to be forced outof him between gasps of pain and there were times when hefeebly tried to compromise when he said to himself i willconfess but not yet i must hold out till the pain becomesunbearable three more kicks two more kicks and then iwill tell them what they want sometimes he was beaten tillhe could hardly stand then flung like a sack of potatoes onto the stone floor of a cell left to recuperate for a few hoursand then taken out and beaten again there were also longer3041984periods of recovery he remembered them dimly becausethey were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor he remembereda cell with a plank bed a sort of shelf sticking out from thewall and a tin washbasin and meals of hot soup and breadand sometimes coffee he remembered a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his hair and businesslikeunsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse tappinghis reflexes turning up his eyelids running harsh fingersover him in search for broken bones and shooting needlesinto his arm to make him sleepthe beatings grew less frequent and became mainly athreat a horror to which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were unsatisfactory his questionersnow were not ruffians in black uniforms but party intellectuals little rotund men with quick movements and flashingspectacles who worked on him in relays over periods whichlasted—he thought he could not be sure—ten or twelvehours at a stretch these other questioners saw to it that hewas in constant slight pain but it was not chiefly pain thatthey relied on they slapped his face wrung his ears pulledhis hair made him stand on one leg refused him leave tourinate shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ranwith water but the aim of this was simply to humiliate himand destroy his power of arguing and reasoning their realweapon was the merciless questioning that went on and onhour after hour tripping him up laying traps for him twisting everything that he said convicting him at every step oflies and selfcontradiction until he began weeping as muchfrom shame as from nervous fatigue sometimes he wouldfree ebooks at planet ebookcom305weep half a dozen times in a single session most of the timethey screamed abuse at him and threatened at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again but sometimesthey would suddenly change their tune call him comradeappeal to him in the name of ingsoc and big brother andask him sorrowfully whether even now he had not enoughloyalty to the party left to make him wish to undo the evilhe had done when his nerves were in rags after hours ofquestioning even this appeal could reduce him to snivelling tears in the end the nagging voices broke him downmore completely than the boots and fists of the guards hebecame simply a mouth that uttered a hand that signedwhatever was demanded of him his sole concern was tofind out what they wanted him to confess and then confessit quickly before the bullying started anew he confessedto the assassination of eminent party members the distribution of seditious pamphlets embezzlement of publicfunds sale of military secrets sabotage of every kind heconfessed that he had been a spy in the pay of the eastasian government as far back as 1968 he confessed that hewas a religious believer an admirer of capitalism and a sexual pervert he confessed that he had murdered his wifealthough he knew and his questioners must have knownthat his wife was still alive he confessed that for years hehad been in personal touch with goldstein and had beena member of an underground organization which had included almost every human being he had ever known itwas easier to confess everything and implicate everybodybesides in a sense it was all true it was true that he had3061984been the enemy of the party and in the eyes of the partythere was no distinction between the thought and the deedthere were also memories of another kind they stoodout in his mind disconnectedly like pictures with blackness all round themhe was in a cell which might have been either dark orlight because he could see nothing except a pair of eyesnear at hand some kind of instrument was ticking slowly and regularly the eyes grew larger and more luminoussuddenly he floated out of his seat dived into the eyes andwas swallowed uphe was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials underdazzling lights a man in a white coat was reading the dialsthere was a tramp of heavy boots outside the door clangedopen the waxedfaced officer marched in followed by twoguardsroom 101 said the officerthe man in the white coat did not turn round he did notlook at winston either he was looking only at the dialshe was rolling down a mighty corridor a kilometrewide full of glorious golden light roaring with laughterand shouting out confessions at the top of his voice he wasconfessing everything even the things he had succeededin holding back under the torture he was relating the entire history of his life to an audience who knew it alreadywith him were the guards the other questioners the menin white coats obrien julia mr charrington all rollingdown the corridor together and shouting with laughtersome dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the fufree ebooks at planet ebookcom307ture had somehow been skipped over and had not happenedeverything was all right there was no more pain the lastdetail of his life was laid bare understood forgivenhe was starting up from the plank bed in the halfcertainty that he had heard obriens voice all through hisinterrogation although he had never seen him he had hadthe feeling that obrien was at his elbow just out of sight itwas obrien who was directing everything it was he whoset the guards on to winston and who prevented them fromkilling him it was he who decided when winston shouldscream with pain when he should have a respite when heshould be fed when he should sleep when the drugs shouldbe pumped into his arm it was he who asked the questions and suggested the answers he was the tormentor hewas the protector he was the inquisitor he was the friendand once—winston could not remember whether it wasin drugged sleep or in normal sleep or even in a momentof wakefulness—a voice murmured in his ear dont worry winston you are in my keeping for seven years i havewatched over you now the turningpoint has come i shallsave you i shall make you perfect he was not sure whetherit was obriens voice but it was the same voice that hadsaid to him we shall meet in the place where there is nodarkness in that other dream seven years agohe did not remember any ending to his interrogationthere was a period of blackness and then the cell or roomin which he now was had gradually materialized round himhe was almost flat on his back and unable to move hisbody was held down at every essential point even the back3081984of his head was gripped in some manner obrien was looking down at him gravely and rather sadly his face seenfrom below looked coarse and worn with pouches underthe eyes and tired lines from nose to chin he was olderthan winston had thought him he was perhaps fortyeightor fifty under his hand there was a dial with a lever on topand figures running round the facei told you said obrien that if we met again it wouldbe hereyes said winstonwithout any warning except a slight movement ofobriens hand a wave of pain flooded his body it was afrightening pain because he could not see what was happening and he had the feeling that some mortal injury wasbeing done to him he did not know whether the thing wasreally happening or whether the effect was electrically produced but his body was being wrenched out of shape thejoints were being slowly torn apart although the pain hadbrought the sweat out on his forehead the worst of all wasthe fear that his backbone was about to snap he set histeeth and breathed hard through his nose trying to keepsilent as long as possibleyou are afraid said obrien watching his face that inanother moment something is going to break your especialfear is that it will be your backbone you have a vivid mentalpicture of the vertebrae snapping apart and the spinal fluiddripping out of them that is what you are thinking is itnot winstonwinston did not answer obrien drew back the lever onfree ebooks at planet ebookcom309the dial the wave of pain receded almost as quickly as ithad comethat was forty said obrien you can see that the numbers on this dial run up to a hundred will you pleaseremember throughout our conversation that i have it inmy power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to whatever degree i choose if you tell me any lies or attempt toprevaricate in any way or even fall below your usual levelof intelligence you will cry out with pain instantly do youunderstand thatyes said winstonobriens manner became less severe he resettled hisspectacles thoughtfully and took a pace or two up anddown when he spoke his voice was gentle and patient hehad the air of a doctor a teacher even a priest anxious toexplain and persuade rather than to punishi am taking trouble with you winston he said becauseyou are worth trouble you know perfectly well what is thematter with you you have known it for years though youhave fought against the knowledge you are mentally deranged you suffer from a defective memory you are unableto remember real events and you persuade yourself that youremember other events which never happened fortunatelyit is curable you have never cured yourself of it becauseyou did not choose to there was a small effort of the willthat you were not ready to make even now i am well awareyou are clinging to your disease under the impression thatit is a virtue now we will take an example at this momentwhich power is oceania at war with3101984when i was arrested oceania was at war with eastasiawith eastasia good and oceania has always been atwar with eastasia has it notwinston drew in his breath he opened his mouth tospeak and then did not speak he could not take his eyesaway from the dialthe truth please winston your truth tell me whatyou think you rememberi remember that until only a week before i was arrestedwe were not at war with eastasia at all we were in alliancewith them the war was against eurasia that had lasted forfour years before that——obrien stopped him with a movement of the handanother example he said some years ago you had avery serious delusion indeed you believed that three menthree onetime party members named jones aaronsonand rutherford—men who were executed for treacheryand sabotage after making the fullest possible confession—were not guilty of the crimes they were charged with youbelieved that you had seen unmistakable documentary evidence proving that their confessions were false there wasa certain photograph about which you had a hallucinationyou believed that you had actually held it in your hands itwas a photograph something like thisan oblong slip of newspaper had appeared betweenobriens fingers for perhaps five seconds it was within theangle of winstons vision it was a photograph and therewas no question of its identity it was the photograph itwas another copy of the photograph of jones aaronsonfree ebooks at planet ebookcom311and rutherford at the party function in new york whichhe had chanced upon eleven years ago and promptly destroyed for only an instant it was before his eyes then itwas out of sight again but he had seen it unquestionably hehad seen it he made a desperate agonizing effort to wrenchthe top half of his body free it was impossible to move somuch as a centimetre in any direction for the moment hehad even forgotten the dial all he wanted was to hold thephotograph in his fingers again or at least to see itit exists he criedno said obrienhe stepped across the room there was a memory holein the opposite wall obrien lifted the grating unseen thefrail slip of paper was whirling away on the current of warmair it was vanishing in a flash of flame obrien turned awayfrom the wallashes he said not even identifiable ashes dust it doesnot exist it never existedbut it did exist it does exist it exists in memory i remember it you remember iti do not remember it said obrienwinstons heart sank that was doublethink he had afeeling of deadly helplessness if he could have been certainthat obrien was lying it would not have seemed to matterbut it was perfectly possible that obrien had really forgotten the photograph and if so then already he would haveforgotten his denial of remembering it and forgotten theact of forgetting how could one be sure that it was simpletrickery perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could3121984really happen that was the thought that defeated himobrien was looking down at him speculatively morethan ever he had the air of a teacher taking pains with awayward but promising childthere is a party slogan dealing with the control of thepast he said repeat it if you pleasewho controls the past controls the future who controlsthe present controls the past repeated winston obedientlywho controls the present controls the past saidobrien nodding his head with slow approval is it youropinion winston that the past has real existenceagain the feeling of helplessness descended upon winston his eyes flitted towards the dial he not only did notknow whether yes or no was the answer that would savehim from pain he did not even know which answer he believed to be the true oneobrien smiled faintly you are no metaphysician winston he said until this moment you had never consideredwhat is meant by existence i will put it more precisely doesthe past exist concretely in space is there somewhere orother a place a world of solid objects where the past is stillhappeningnothen where does the past exist if at allin records it is written downin records and——in the mind in human memoriesin memory very well then we the party control allfree ebooks at planet ebookcom313records and we control all memories then we control thepast do we notbut how can you stop people remembering things criedwinston again momentarily forgetting the dial it is involuntary it is outside oneself how can you control memoryyou have not controlled mineobriens manner grew stern again he laid his hand onthe dialon the contrary he said you have not controlled itthat is what has brought you here you are here becauseyou have failed in humility in selfdiscipline you wouldnot make the act of submission which is the price of sanity you preferred to be a lunatic a minority of one onlythe disciplined mind can see reality winston you believethat reality is something objective external existing in itsown right you also believe that the nature of reality is selfevident when you delude yourself into thinking that yousee something you assume that everyone else sees the samething as you but i tell you winston that reality is not external reality exists in the human mind and nowhere elsenot in the individual mind which can make mistakes andin any case soon perishes only in the mind of the partywhich is collective and immortal whatever the party holdsto be the truth is truth it is impossible to see reality exceptby looking through the eyes of the party that is the factthat you have got to relearn winston it needs an act of selfdestruction an effort of the will you must humble yourselfbefore you can become sanehe paused for a few moments as though to allow what3141984he had been saying to sink indo you remember he went on writing in your diary freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two makefouryes said winstonobrien held up his left hand its back towards winstonwith the thumb hidden and the four fingers extendedhow many fingers am i holding up winstonfourand if the party says that it is not four but five—thenhow manyfourthe word ended in a gasp of pain the needle of the dialhad shot up to fiftyfive the sweat had sprung out all overwinstons body the air tore into his lungs and issued againin deep groans which even by clenching his teeth he couldnot stop obrien watched him the four fingers still extended he drew back the lever this time the pain was onlyslightly easedhow many fingers winstonfourthe needle went up to sixtyhow many fingers winstonfour four what else can i say fourthe needle must have risen again but he did not look atit the heavy stern face and the four fingers filled his visionthe fingers stood up before his eyes like pillars enormousblurry and seeming to vibrate but unmistakably fourhow many fingers winstonfree ebooks at planet ebookcom315four stop it stop it how can you go on four fourhow many fingers winstonfive five fiveno winston that is no use you are lying you still thinkthere are four how many fingers pleasefour five four anything you like only stop it stopthe painabruptly he was sitting up with obriens arm round hisshoulders he had perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds the bonds that had held his body down were loosenedhe felt very cold he was shaking uncontrollably his teethwere chattering the tears were rolling down his cheeks fora moment he clung to obrien like a baby curiously comforted by the heavy arm round his shoulders he had thefeeling that obrien was his protector that the pain wassomething that came from outside from some other sourceand that it was obrien who would save him from ityou are a slow learner winston said obrien gentlyhow can i help it he blubbered how can i help seeingwhat is in front of my eyes two and two are foursometimes winston sometimes they are five sometimes they are three sometimes they are all of them at onceyou must try harder it is not easy to become sanehe laid winston down on the bed the grip of his limbstightened again but the pain had ebbed away and thetrembling had stopped leaving him merely weak and coldobrien motioned with his head to the man in the whitecoat who had stood immobile throughout the proceedingsthe man in the white coat bent down and looked closely3161984into winstons eyes felt his pulse laid an ear against hischest tapped here and there then he nodded to obrienagain said obrienthe pain flowed into winstons body the needle must beat seventy seventyfive he had shut his eyes this time heknew that the fingers were still there and still four all thatmattered was somehow to stay alive until the spasm wasover he had ceased to notice whether he was crying out ornot the pain lessened again he opened his eyes obrienhad drawn back the leverhow many fingers winstonfour i suppose there are four i would see five if i couldi am trying to see fivewhich do you wish to persuade me that you see five orreally to see themreally to see themagain said obrienperhaps the needle was eighty—ninety winston couldnot intermittently remember why the pain was happeningbehind his screwedup eyelids a forest of fingers seemed tobe moving in a sort of dance weaving in and out disappearing behind one another and reappearing again he wastrying to count them he could not remember why he knewonly that it was impossible to count them and that this wassomehow due to the mysterious identity between five andfour the pain died down again when he opened his eyesit was to find that he was still seeing the same thing innumerable fingers like moving trees were still streamingpast in either direction crossing and recrossing he shutfree ebooks at planet ebookcom317his eyes againhow many fingers am i holding up winstoni dont know i dont know you will kill me if you do thatagain four five six—in all honesty i dont knowbetter said obriena needle slid into winstons arm almost in the same instant a blissful healing warmth spread all through his bodythe pain was already halfforgotten he opened his eyesand looked up gratefully at obrien at sight of the heavylined face so ugly and so intelligent his heart seemed toturn over if he could have moved he would have stretchedout a hand and laid it on obriens arm he had never lovedhim so deeply as at this moment and not merely becausehe had stopped the pain the old feeling that at bottom itdid not matter whether obrien was a friend or an enemyhad come back obrien was a person who could be talkedto perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to beunderstood obrien had tortured him to the edge of lunacy and in a little while it was certain he would send himto his death it made no difference in some sense that wentdeeper than friendship they were intimates somewhere orother although the actual words might never be spokenthere was a place where they could meet and talk obrienwas looking down at him with an expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind whenhe spoke it was in an easy conversational tonedo you know where you are winston he saidi dont know i can guess in the ministry of lovedo you know how long you have been here3181984i dont know days weeks months—i think it ismonthsand why do you imagine that we bring people to thisplaceto make them confessno that is not the reason try againto punish themno exclaimed obrien his voice had changed extraordinarily and his face had suddenly become both stern andanimated no not merely to extract your confession not topunish you shall i tell you why we have brought you hereto cure you to make you sane will you understand winston that no one whom we bring to this place ever leavesour hands uncured we are not interested in those stupidcrimes that you have committed the party is not interestedin the overt act the thought is all we care about we do notmerely destroy our enemies we change them do you understand what i mean by thathe was bending over winston his face looked enormousbecause of its nearness and hideously ugly because it wasseen from below moreover it was filled with a sort of exaltation a lunatic intensity again winstons heart shrank ifit had been possible he would have cowered deeper into thebed he felt certain that obrien was about to twist the dialout of sheer wantonness at this moment however obrienturned away he took a pace or two up and down then hecontinued less vehementlythe first thing for you to understand is that in this placethere are no martyrdoms you have read of the religiousfree ebooks at planet ebookcom319persecutions of the past in the middle ages there was theinquisitlon it was a failure it set out to eradicate heresy andended by perpetuating it for every heretic it burned at thestake thousands of others rose up why was that becausethe inquisition killed its enemies in the open and killedthem while they were still unrepentant in fact it killedthem because they were unrepentant men were dying because they would not abandon their true beliefs naturallyall the glory belonged to the victim and all the shame to theinquisitor who burned him later in the twentieth centurythere were the totalitarians as they were called there werethe german nazis and the russian communists the russians persecuted heresy more cruelly than the inquisitionhad done and they imagined that they had learned fromthe mistakes of the past they knew at any rate that onemust not make martyrs before they exposed their victimsto public trial they deliberately set themselves to destroytheir dignity they wore them down by torture and solitudeuntil they were despicable cringing wretches confessingwhatever was put into their mouths covering themselveswith abuse accusing and sheltering behind one anotherwhimpering for mercy and yet after only a few years thesame thing had happened over again the dead men hadbecome martyrs and their degradation was forgotten onceagain why was it in the first place because the confessionsthat they had made were obviously extorted and untrue wedo not make mistakes of that kind all the confessions thatare uttered here are true we make them true and aboveall we do not allow the dead to rise up against us you must3201984stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you winstonposterity will never hear of you you will be lifted clean outfrom the stream of history we shall turn you into gas andpour you into the stratosphere nothing will remain of younot a name in a register not a memory in a living brain youwill be annihilated in the past as well as in the future youwill never have existedthen why bother to torture me thought winston with amomentary bitterness obrien checked his step as thoughwinston had uttered the thought aloud his large ugly facecame nearer with the eyes a little narrowedyou are thinking he said that since we intend to destroy you utterly so that nothing that you say or do canmake the smallest difference—in that case why do we go tothe trouble of interrogating you first that is what you werethinking was it notyes said winstonobrien smiled slightly you are a flaw in the patternwinston you are a stain that must be wiped out did i nottell you just now that we are different from the persecutorsof the past we are not content with negative obedience noreven with the most abject submission when finally yousurrender to us it must be of your own free will we do notdestroy the heretic because he resists us so long as he resists us we never destroy him we convert him we capturehis inner mind we reshape him we burn all evil and allillusion out of him we bring him over to our side not in appearance but genuinely heart and soul we make him oneof ourselves before we kill him it is intolerable to us thatfree ebooks at planet ebookcom321an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the worldhowever secret and powerless it may be even in the instantof death we can not permit any deviation in the old days theheretic walked to the stake still a heretic proclaiming hisheresy exulting in it even the victim of the russian purgescould carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walkeddown the passage waiting for the bullet but we make thebrain perfect before we blow it out the command of the olddespotisms was thou shalt not the command of the totalitarians was thou shalt our command is thou artno one whom we bring to this place ever stands out againstus everyone is washed clean even those three miserabletraitors in whose innocence you once believed—jones aaronson and rutherford—in the end we broke them down itook part in their interrogation myself i saw them gradually worn down whimpering grovelling weeping—and inthe end it was not with pain or fear only with penitenceby the time we had finished with them they were only theshells of men there was nothing left in them except sorrow for what they had done and love of big brother it wastouching to see how they loved him they begged to be shotquickly so that they could die while their minds were stillcleanhis voice had grown almost dreamy the exaltation thelunatic enthusiasm was still in his face he is not pretending thought winston he is not a hypocrite he believesevery word he says what most oppressed him was the consciousness of his own intellectual inferiority he watchedthe heavy yet graceful form strolling to and fro in and out3221984of the range of his vision obrien was a being in all wayslarger than himself there was no idea that he had ever hador could have that obrien had not long ago known examined and rejected his mind contained winstonsmind but in that case how could it be true that obrien wasmad it must be he winston who was mad obrien haltedand looked down at him his voice had grown stern againdo not imagine that you will save yourself winstonhowever completely you surrender to us no one who hasonce gone astray is ever spared and even if we chose to letyou live out the natural term of your life still you wouldnever escape from us what happens to you here is for everunderstand that in advance we shall crush you down tothe point from which there is no coming back things willhappen to you from which you could not recover if youlived a thousand years never again will you be capable ofordinary human feeling everything will be dead insideyou never again will you be capable of love or friendshipor joy of living or laughter or curiosity or courage or integrity you will be hollow we shall squeeze you empty andthen we shall fill you with ourselveshe paused and signed to the man in the white coatwinston was aware of some heavy piece of apparatus beingpushed into place behind his head obrien had sat downbeside the bed so that his face was almost on a level withwinstonsthree thousand he said speaking over winstons headto the man in the white coattwo soft pads which felt slightly moist clamped themfree ebooks at planet ebookcom323selves against winstons temples he quailed there waspain coming a new kind of pain obrien laid a hand reassuringly almost kindly on histhis time it will not hurt he said keep your eyes fixedon mineat this moment there was a devastating explosion or whatseemed like an explosion though it was not certain whetherthere was any noise there was undoubtedly a blinding flashof light winston was not hurt only prostrated althoughhe had already been lying on his back when the thing happened he had a curious feeling that he had been knockedinto that position a terrific painless blow had flattened himout also something had happened inside his head as hiseyes regained their focus he remembered who he was andwhere he was and recognized the face that was gazing intohis own but somewhere or other there was a large patchof emptiness as though a piece had been taken out of hisbrainit will not last said obrien look me in the eyes whatcountry is oceania at war withwinston thought he knew what was meant by oceaniaand that he himself was a citizen of oceania he also remembered eurasia and eastasia but who was at war withwhom he did not know in fact he had not been aware thatthere was any wari dont rememberoceania is at war with eastasia do you remember thatnowyes3241984oceania has always been at war with eastasia since thebeginning of your life since the beginning of the partysince the beginning of history the war has continued without a break always the same war do you remember thatyeseleven years ago you created a legend about three menwho had been condemned to death for treachery you pretended that you had seen a piece of paper which provedthem innocent no such piece of paper ever existed you invented it and later you grew to believe in it you remembernow the very moment at which you first invented it do youremember thatyesjust now i held up the fingers of my hand to you you sawfive fingers do you remember thatyesobrien held up the fingers of his left hand with thethumb concealedthere are five fingers there do you see five fingersyesand he did see them for a fleeting instant before thescenery of his mind changed he saw five fingers and therewas no deformity then everything was normal again andthe old fear the hatred and the bewilderment came crowding back again but there had been a moment—he did notknow how long thirty seconds perhaps—of luminous certainty when each new suggestion of obriens had filled upa patch of emptiness and become absolute truth and whentwo and two could have been three as easily as five if thatfree ebooks at planet ebookcom325were what was needed it had faded but before obrien haddropped his hand but though he could not recapture it hecould remember it as one remembers a vivid experience atsome period of ones life when one was in effect a differentpersonyou see now said obrien that it is at any rate possibleyes said winstonobrien stood up with a satisfied air over to his leftwinston saw the man in the white coat break an ampouleand draw back the plunger of a syringe obrien turned towinston with a smile in almost the old manner he resettledhis spectacles on his nosedo you remember writing in your diary he said thatit did not matter whether i was a friend or an enemy sincei was at least a person who understood you and could betalked to you were right i enjoy talking to you your mindappeals to me it resembles my own mind except that youhappen to be insane before we bring the session to an endyou can ask me a few questions if you chooseany question i likeanything he saw that winstons eyes were upon thedial it is switched off what is your first questionwhat have you done with julia said winstonobrien smiled again she betrayed you winston immediately—unreservedly i have seldom seen anyone comeover to us so promptly you would hardly recognize her ifyou saw her all her rebelliousness her deceit her folly herdirtymindedness—everything has been burned out of her3261984it was a perfect conversion a textbook caseyou tortured herobrien left this unanswered next question he saiddoes big brother existof course he exists the party exists big brother is theembodiment of the partydoes he exist in the same way as i existyou do not exist said obrienonce again the sense of helplessness assailed him heknew or he could imagine the arguments which provedhis own nonexistence but they were nonsense they wereonly a play on words did not the statement you do not exist contain a logical absurdity but what use was it to sayso his mind shrivelled as he thought of the unanswerablemad arguments with which obrien would demolish himi think i exist he said wearily i am conscious of myown identity i was born and i shall die i have arms andlegs i occupy a particular point in space no other solidobject can occupy the same point simultaneously in thatsense does big brother existit is of no importance he existswill big brother ever dieof course not how could he die next questiondoes the brotherhood existthat winston you will never know if we choose to setyou free when we have finished with you and if you live tobe ninety years old still you will never learn whether theanswer to that question is yes or no as long as you live itwill be an unsolved riddle in your mindfree ebooks at planet ebookcom327winston lay silent his breast rose and fell a little fasterhe still had not asked the question that had come into hismind the first he had got to ask it and yet it was as thoughhis tongue would not utter it there was a trace of amusement in obriens face even his spectacles seemed to wearan ironical gleam he knows thought winston suddenlyhe knows what i am going to ask at the thought the wordsburst out of himwhat is in room 101the expression on obriens face did not change he answered drilyyou know what is in room 101 winston everyoneknows what is in room 101he raised a finger to the man in the white coat evidentlythe session was at an end a needle jerked into winstonsarm he sank almost instantly into deep sleep3281984chapter 3there are three stages in your reintegration said obrienthere is learning there is understanding and there is acceptance it is time for you to enter upon the second stageas always winston was lying flat on his back but of latehis bonds were looser they still held him to the bed buthe could move his knees a little and could turn his headfrom side to side and raise his arms from the elbow thedial also had grown to be less of a terror he could evade itspangs if he was quickwitted enough it was chiefly when heshowed stupidity that obrien pulled the lever sometimesthey got through a whole session without use of the dialhe could not remember how many sessions there had beenthe whole process seemed to stretch out over a long indefinite time—weeks possibly—and the intervals between thesessions might sometimes have been days sometimes onlyan hour or twoas you lie there said obrien you have often wondered—you have even asked me—why the ministry of loveshould expend so much time and trouble on you and whenyou were free you were puzzled by what was essentially thesame question you could grasp the mechanics of the society you lived in but not its underlying motives do youremember writing in your diary i understand how i donot understand why it was when you thought aboutfree ebooks at planet ebookcom329why that you doubted your own sanity you have read thebook goldsteins book or parts of it at least did it tellyou anything that you did not know alreadyyou have read it said winstoni wrote it that is to say i collaborated in writing it nobook is produced individually as you knowis it true what it saysas description yes the programme it sets forth is nonsense the secret accumulation of knowledge—a gradualspread of enlightenment—ultimately a proletarian rebellion—the overthrow of the party you foresaw yourself thatthat was what it would say it is all nonsense the proletarians will never revolt not in a thousand years or a millionthey can not i do not have to tell you the reason you knowit already if you have ever cherished any dreams of violentinsurrection you must abandon them there is no way inwhich the party can be overthrown the rule of the party isfor ever make that the startingpoint of your thoughtshe came closer to the bed for ever he repeated andnow let us get back to the question of how and why youunderstand well enough how the party maintains itselfin power now tell me why we cling to power what isour motive why should we want power go on speak headded as winston remained silentnevertheless winston did not speak for another moment or two a feeling of weariness had overwhelmed himthe faint mad gleam of enthusiasm had come back intoobriens face he knew in advance what obrien would saythat the party did not seek power for its own ends but only3301984for the good of the majority that it sought power becausemen in the mass were frail cowardly creatures who couldnot endure liberty or face the truth and must be ruled overand systematically deceived by others who were strongerthan themselves that the choice for mankind lay betweenfreedom and happiness and that for the great bulk of mankind happiness was better that the party was the eternalguardian of the weak a dedicated sect doing evil that goodmight come sacrificing its own happiness to that of others the terrible thing thought winston the terrible thingwas that when obrien said this he would believe it youcould see it in his face obrien knew everything a thousand times better than winston he knew what the worldwas really like in what degradation the mass of human beings lived and by what lies and barbarities the party keptthem there he had understood it all weighed it all and itmade no difference all was justified by the ultimate purposewhat can you do thought winston against the lunatic whois more intelligent than yourself who gives your argumentsa fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacyyou are ruling over us for our own good he said feeblyyou believe that human beings are not fit to govern themselves and therefore——he started and almost cried out a pang of pain had shotthrough his body obrien had pushed the lever of the dialup to thirtyfivethat was stupid winston stupid he said you shouldknow better than to say a thing like thathe pulled the lever back and continuedfree ebooks at planet ebookcom331now i will tell you the answer to my question it is thisthe party seeks power entirely for its own sake we are notinterested in the good of others we are interested solelyin power not wealth or luxury or long life or happinessonly power pure power what pure power means you willunderstand presently we are different from all the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing allthe others even those who resembled ourselves were cowards and hypocrites the german nazis and the russiancommunists came very close to us in their methods butthey never had the courage to recognize their own motivesthey pretended perhaps they even believed that they hadseized power unwillingly and for a limited time and thatjust round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal we are not like that we knowthat no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it power is not a means it is an end one does notestablish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolutionone makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship the object of persecution is persecution the object oftorture is torture the object of power is power now do youbegin to understand mewinston was struck as he had been struck before by thetiredness of obriens face it was strong and fleshy and brutal it was full of intelligence and a sort of controlled passionbefore which he felt himself helpless but it was tired therewere pouches under the eyes the skin sagged from thecheekbones obrien leaned over him deliberately bringingthe worn face nearer3321984you are thinking he said that my face is old and tiredyou are thinking that i talk of power and yet i am not evenable to prevent the decay of my own body can you not understand winston that the individual is only a cell theweariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism do youdie when you cut your fingernailshe turned away from the bed and began strolling up anddown again one hand in his pocketwe are the priests of power he said god is power butat present power is only a word so far as you are concernedit is time for you to gather some idea of what power meansthe first thing you must realize is that power is collectivethe individual only has power in so far as he ceases to be anindividual you know the party slogan freedom is slaveryhas it ever occurred to you that it is reversible slavery isfreedom alone—free—the human being is always defeatedit must be so because every human being is doomed to diewhich is the greatest of all failures but if he can make complete utter submission if he can escape from his identityif he can merge himself in the party so that he is the partythen he is allpowerful and immortal the second thing foryou to realize is that power is power over human beingsover the body—but above all over the mind power overmatter—external reality as you would call it—is not important already our control over matter is absolutefor a moment winston ignored the dial he made a violent effort to raise himself into a sitting position and merelysucceeded in wrenching his body painfullybut how can you control matter he burst out you dontfree ebooks at planet ebookcom333even control the climate or the law of gravity and there aredisease pain death——obrien silenced him by a movement of his hand wecontrol matter because we control the mind reality is inside the skull you will learn by degrees winston there isnothing that we could not do invisibility levitation—anything i could float off this floor like a soap bubble if i wishto i do not wish to because the party does not wish it youmust get rid of those nineteenthcentury ideas about thelaws of nature we make the laws of naturebut you do not you are not even masters of this planetwhat about eurasia and eastasia you have not conqueredthem yetunimportant we shall conquer them when it suits usand if we did not what difference would it make we canshut them out of existence oceania is the worldbut the world itself is only a speck of dust and man istiny—helpless how long has he been in existence for millions of years the earth was uninhabitednonsense the earth is as old as we are no older howcould it be older nothing exists except through humanconsciousnessbut the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals—mammoths and mastodons and enormous reptiles whichlived here long before man was ever heard ofhave you ever seen those bones winston of course notnineteenthcentury biologists invented them before manthere was nothing after man if he could come to an endthere would be nothing outside man there is nothing3341984but the whole universe is outside us look at the starssome of them are a million lightyears away they are out ofour reach for everwhat are the stars said obrien indifferently they arebits of fire a few kilometres away we could reach them if wewanted to or we could blot them out the earth is the centre of the universe the sun and the stars go round itwinston made another convulsive movement this timehe did not say anything obrien continued as though answering a spoken objectionfor certain purposes of course that is not true whenwe navigate the ocean or when we predict an eclipse we often find it convenient to assume that the earth goes roundthe sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of kilometres away but what of it do you suppose it is beyondus to produce a dual system of astronomy the stars can benear or distant according as we need them do you supposeour mathematicians are unequal to that have you forgotten doublethinkwinston shrank back upon the bed whatever he saidthe swift answer crushed him like a bludgeon and yet heknew he knew that he was in the right the belief thatnothing exists outside your own mind—surely there mustbe some way of demonstrating that it was false had it notbeen exposed long ago as a fallacy there was even a namefor it which he had forgotten a faint smile twitched thecorners of obriens mouth as he looked down at himi told you winston he said that metaphysics is notyour strong point the word you are trying to think of isfree ebooks at planet ebookcom335solipsism but you are mistaken this is not solipsism collective solipsism if you like but that is a different thing infact the opposite thing all this is a digression he addedin a different tone the real power the power we have tofight for night and day is not power over things but overmen he paused and for a moment assumed again his airof a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil how doesone man assert his power over another winstonwinston thought by making him suffer he saidexactly by making him suffer obedience is not enoughunless he is suffering how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own power is in inflicting painand humiliation power is in tearing human minds to piecesand putting them together again in new shapes of your ownchoosing do you begin to see then what kind of world weare creating it is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic utopias that the old reformers imagined a world of fearand treachery and torment a world of trampling and beingtrampled upon a world which will grow not less but moremerciless as it refines itself progress in our world will beprogress towards more pain the old civilizations claimedthat they were founded on love or justice ours is foundedupon hatred in our world there will be no emotions except fear rage triumph and selfabasement everythingelse we shall destroy—everything already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived frombefore the revolution we have cut the links between childand parent and between man and man and between manand woman no one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend3361984any longer but in the future there will be no wives andno friends children will be taken from their mothers atbirth as one takes eggs from a hen the sex instinct will beeradicated procreation will be an annual formality like therenewal of a ration card we shall abolish the orgasm ourneurologists are at work upon it now there will be no loyalty except loyalty towards the party there will be no loveexcept the love of big brother there will be no laughter except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy there willbe no art no literature no science when we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science there will be nodistinction between beauty and ugliness there will be nocuriosity no enjoyment of the process of life all competingpleasures will be destroyed but always—do not forget thiswinston—always there will be the intoxication of powerconstantly increasing and constantly growing subtler always at every moment there will be the thrill of victorythe sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless ifyou want a picture of the future imagine a boot stampingon a human face—for everhe paused as though he expected winston to speakwinston had tried to shrink back into the surface of the bedagain he could not say anything his heart seemed to befrozen obrien went onand remember that it is for ever the face will alwaysbe there to be stamped upon the heretic the enemy of society will always be there so that he can be defeated andhumiliated over again everything that you have undergonesince you have been in our hands—all that will continuefree ebooks at planet ebookcom337and worse the espionage the betrayals the arrests the tortures the executions the disappearances will never ceaseit will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumphthe more the party is powerful the less it will be tolerantthe weaker the opposition the tighter the despotism goldstein and his heresies will live for ever every day at everymoment they will be defeated discredited ridiculed spatupon and yet they will always survive this drama that ihave played out with you during seven years will be playedout over and over again generation after generation alwaysin subtler forms always we shall have the heretic here at ourmercy screaming with pain broken up contemptible—andin the end utterly penitent saved from himself crawling toour feet of his own accord that is the world that we are preparing winston a world of victory after victory triumphafter triumph after triumph an endless pressing pressingpressing upon the nerve of power you are beginning i cansee to realize what that world will be like but in the endyou will do more than understand it you will accept it welcome it become part of itwinston had recovered himself sufficiently to speakyou cant he said weaklywhat do you mean by that remark winstonyou could not create such a world as you have just described it is a dream it is impossiblewhyit is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatredand cruelty it would never endurewhy not3381984it would have no vitality it would disintegrate it wouldcommit suicidenonsense you are under the impression that hatred ismore exhausting than love why should it be and if it werewhat difference would that make suppose that we chooseto wear ourselves out faster suppose that we quicken thetempo of human life till men are senile at thirty still whatdifference would it make can you not understand that thedeath of the individual is not death the party is immortalas usual the voice had battered winston into helplessness moreover he was in dread that if he persisted in hisdisagreement obrien would twist the dial again and yethe could not keep silent feebly without arguments withnothing to support him except his inarticulate horror ofwhat obrien had said he returned to the attacki dont know—i dont care somehow you will fail something will defeat you life will defeat youwe control life winston at all its levels you are imagining that there is something called human nature whichwill be outraged by what we do and will turn against us butwe create human nature men are infinitely malleable orperhaps you have returned to your old idea that the proletarians or the slaves will arise and overthrow us put it outof your mind they are helpless like the animals humanityis the party

superior to us with ourlies and our crueltyyes i consider myself superiorobrien did not speak two other voices were speakingafter a moment winston recognized one of them as hisown it was a soundtrack of the conversation he had hadwith obrien on the night when he had enrolled himself inthe brotherhood he heard himself promising to lie to stealto forge to murder to encourage drugtaking and prostitution to disseminate venereal diseases to throw vitriolin a childs face obrien made a small impatient gestureas though to say that the demonstration was hardly worthmaking then he turned a switch and the voices stoppedget up from that bed he said3401984the bonds had loosened themselves winston loweredhimself to the floor and stood up unsteadilyyou are the last man said obrien you are the guardian of the human spirit you shall see yourself as you aretake off your clotheswinston undid the bit of string that held his overalls together the zip fastener had long since been wrenched out ofthem he could not remember whether at any time since hisarrest he had taken off all his clothes at one time beneaththe overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish ragsjust recognizable as the remnants of underclothes as heslid them to the ground he saw that there was a threesidedmirror at the far end of the room he approached it thenstopped short an involuntary cry had broken out of himgo

certainly it was his own facebut it seemed to him that it had changed more than he hadchanged inside the emotions it registered would be different from the ones he felt he had gone partially bald for thefree ebooks at planet ebookcom341first moment he had thought that he had gone grey as wellbut it was only the scalp that was grey except for his handsand a circle of his face his body was grey all over with ancient ingrained dirt here and there under the dirt therewere the red scars of wounds and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an inflamed mass with flakes of skin peelingoff it but the truly frightening thing was the emaciation ofhis body the barrel of the ribs was as narrow as that of askeleton the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thickerthan the thighs he saw now what obrien had meant aboutseeing the side view the curvature of the spine was astonishing the thin shoulders were hunched forward so as tomake a cavity of the chest the scraggy neck seemed to bebending double under the weight of the skull at a guess hewould have said that it was the body of a man of sixty suffering from some malignant diseaseyou have thought sometimes said obrien that myface—the face of a member of the inner party—looks oldand worn what do you think of your own facehe seized winstons shoulder and spun him round sothat he was facing himlook at the condition you are in he said look at

mirror again do you see that thing facing youthat is the last man if you are human that is humanitynow put your clothes on againwinston began to dress himself with slow stiff movements until now he had not seemed to notice how thin andweak he was only one thought stirred in his mind that hemust have been in this place longer than he had imaginedthen suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himselfa feeling of pity for his ruined body overcame him beforehe knew what he was doing he had collapsed on to a smallstool that stood beside the bed and burst into tears he wasaware of his ugliness his gracelessness a bundle of bones infilthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white lightbut he could not stop himself obrien laid a hand on hisshoulder almost kindlyit will not last for ever

screamed with pain you have rolled on the floor inyour own blood and vomit you have whimpered for mercyyou have betrayed everybody and everything can you thinkof a single degradation that has not happened to youwinston had stopped weeping though the tears werestill oozing out of his eyes he looked up at obrieni have not betrayed julia he saidobrien looked down at him thoughtfully no he saidno that is perfectly true you have not betrayed juliathe peculiar reverence for obrien which nothingseemed able to destroy flooded winstons heart again howintelligent he thought how intelligent never did obrienfail to understand what was said to him anyone else onearth would have answered promptly that he had betrayed julia for what was there that they had not screwedout of him under the torture he had told them everythinghe knew about her her habits her character her past lifehe had confessed in the most trivial detail everything thathad happened at their meetings all that he had said to her3441984and she to him their blackmarket meals their adulteriestheir vague plottings against the party—everything andyet in the sense in which he intended the word he had notbetrayed her he had not stopped loving her his feelings towards her had remained the same obrien had seen whathe meant without the need for explanationtell me he said how soon will they shoot meit might be a long time said

and strongerevery day if it was proper to speak of daysthe white light and the humming sound were the sameas ever but the cell was a little more comfortable than theothers he had been in there was a pillow and a mattress onthe plank bed and a stool to sit on they had given him abath and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequently in a tin basin they even gave him warm water to washwith they had given him new underclothes and a clean suitof overalls they had dressed his varicose ulcer with soothing ointment they had pulled out the remnants of his teethand given him a new set of denturesweeks or months must have passed it would have beenpossible now to keep count of the passage of time if he hadfelt any interest in doing so since he was being fed at whatappeared to be regular intervals he was getting he judgedthree meals in the twentyfour hours sometimes he wondered dimly whether he was getting them by night or by daythe food was surprisingly good with meat at every thirdmeal once there was even a packet of cigarettes he hadno matches but the neverspeaking guard who brought hisfood would give him a light the first time he tried to smokeit made him sick but he persevered and spun the packet outfor a long time smoking half a cigarette after each meal3461984they had given him a white slate with a stump of penciltied to the corner at first he made no use of it even whenhe was awake he was completely torpid often he would liefrom one meal to the next almost without stirring sometimes asleep sometimes waking into vague reveries in whichit was too much trouble to open his eyes he had long grownused to sleeping with a strong light on his face it seemedto make no difference except that ones dreams were morecoherent he dreamed a great deal all through this timeand they were always happy dreams he was in the goldencountry or he was sitting among enormous glorious sunlitruins with his mother with julia with obrien—not doing anything merely sitting in the sun talking of peacefulthings such thoughts as he had when he was awake weremostly about his dreams he seemed to have lost the powerof intellectual effort now that the stimulus of pain had beenremoved he was not bored he had no desire for conversation or distraction merely to be alone not to be beaten orquestioned to have enough to eat and to be clean all overwas completely satisfyingby degrees he came to spend less time in sleep but he stillfelt no impulse to get off the bed all he cared for was to liequiet and feel the strength gathering in his body he wouldfinger himself here and there trying to make sure that itwas not an illusion that his muscles were growing rounder and his skin tauter finally it was established beyond adoubt that he was growing fatter his thighs were now definitely thicker than his knees after that reluctantly at firsthe began exercising himself regularly in a little while hefree ebooks at planet ebookcom347could walk three kilometres measured by pacing the celland his bowed shoulders were growing straighter he attempted more elaborate exercises and was astonished andhumiliated to find what things he could not do he couldnot move out of a walk he could not hold his stool out atarms length he could not stand on one leg without fallingover he squatted down on his heels and found that withagonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himselfto a standing position he lay flat on his belly and tried tolift his weight by his hands it was hopeless he could notraise himself a centimetre but after a few more days—a fewmore mealtimes—even that feat was accomplished a timecame when he could do it six times running he began togrow actually proud of his body and to cherish an intermittent belief that his face also was growing back to normalonly when he chanced to put his hand on his bald scalp didhe remember the seamed ruined face that had looked backat him out of the mirrorhis mind grew more active he sat down on the plankbed his back against the wall and the slate on his kneesand set to work deliberately at the task of reeducating himselfhe had capitulated that was agreed in reality as he sawnow he had been ready to capitulate long before he hadtaken the decision from the moment when he was insidethe ministry of love—and yes even during those minuteswhen he and julia had stood helpless while the iron voicefrom the telescreen told them what to do—he had graspedthe frivolity the shallowness of his attempt to set himself3481984up against the power of the party he knew now that forseven years the thought police had watched him like a beetle under a magnifying glass there was no physical act noword spoken aloud that they had not noticed no train ofthought that they had not been able to infer even the speckof whitish dust on the cover of his diary they had carefully replaced they had played soundtracks to him shownhim photographs some of them were photographs of juliaand himself yes even he could not fight against the partyany longer besides the party was in the right it must beso how could the immortal collective brain be mistakenby what external standard could you check its judgementssanity was statistical it was merely a question of learningto think as they thought only——the pencil felt thick and awkward in his fingers he began to write down the thoughts that came into his head hewrote first in large clumsy capitalsfreedom is slaverythen almost without a pause he wrote beneath ittwo and two make fivebut then there came a sort of check his mind as thoughshying away from something seemed unable to concentrate he knew that he knew what came next but for themoment he could not recall it when he did recall it it wasonly by consciously reasoning out what it must be it did notfree ebooks at planet ebookcom349come of its own accord he wrotegod is powerhe accepted everything the past was alterable the pastnever had been altered oceania was at war with eastasiaoceania had always been at war with eastasia jones aaronson and rutherford were guilty of the crimes they werecharged with he had never seen the photograph that disproved their guilt it had never existed he had invented ithe remembered remembering contrary things but thosewere false memories products of selfdeception how easy itall was only surrender and everything else followed it waslike swimming against a current that swept you backwardshowever hard you struggled and then suddenly deciding toturn round and go with the current instead of opposing itnothing had changed except your own attitude the predestined thing happened in any case he hardly knew why hehad ever rebelled everything was easy except——anything could be true the socalled laws of nature were nonsense the law of gravity was nonsense if iwished obrien had said i could float off this floor likea soap bubble winston worked it out if he thinks hefloats off the floor and if i simultaneously think i seehim do it then the thing happens suddenly like a lumpof submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water thethought burst into his mind it doesnt really happen weimagine it it is hallucination he pushed the thought under instantly the fallacy was obvious it presupposed that3501984somewhere or other outside oneself there was a real worldwhere real things happened but how could there be such aworld what knowledge have we of anything save throughour own minds all happenings are in the mind whateverhappens in all minds truly happenshe had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy and hewas in no danger of succumbing to it he realized nevertheless that it ought never to have occurred to him themind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerousthought presented itself the process should be automaticinstinctive crimestop they called it in newspeakhe set to work to exercise himself in crimestop he presented himself with propositions—the party says the earthis flat the party says that ice is heavier than water—andtrained himself in not seeing or not understanding the arguments that contradicted them it was not easy it neededgreat powers of reasoning and improvisation the arithmetical problems raised for instance by such a statementas two and two make five were beyond his intellectualgrasp it needed also a sort of athleticism of mind an abilityat one moment to make the most delicate use of logic andat the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical errorsstupidity was as necessary as intelligence and as difficultto attainall the while with one part of his mind he wonderedhow soon they would shoot him everything depends onyourself obrien had said but he knew that there was noconscious act by which he could bring it nearer it mightbe ten minutes hence or ten years they might keep himfree ebooks at planet ebookcom351for years in solitary confinement they might send him toa labourcamp they might release him for a while as theysometimes did it was perfectly possible that before he wasshot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation wouldbe enacted all over again the one certain thing was thatdeath never came at an expected moment the tradition—the unspoken tradition somehow you knew it though younever heard it said—was that they shot you from behindalways in the back of the head without warning as youwalked down a corridor from cell to cellone day—but one day was not the right expression justas probably it was in the middle of the night once—he fellinto a strange blissful reverie he was walking down thecorridor waiting for the bullet he knew that it was coming in another moment everything was settled smoothedout reconciled there were no more doubts no more arguments no more pain no more fear his body was healthyand strong he walked easily with a joy of movement andwith a feeling of walking in sunlight he was not any longerin the narrow white corridors in the ministry of love hewas in the enormous sunlit passage a kilometre wide downwhich he had seemed to walk in the delirium induced bydrugs he was in the golden country following the foottrack across the old rabbitcropped pasture he could feelthe short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sunshine on his face at the edge of the field were the elm treesfaintly stirring and somewhere beyond that was the streamwhere the dace lay in the green pools under the willowssuddenly he started up with a shock of horror the3521984sweat broke out on his backbone he had heard himself cryaloudjulia julia julia my love juliafor a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination of her presence she had seemed to be not merely withhim but inside him it was as though she had got into thetexture of his skin in that moment he had loved her farmore than he had ever done when they were together andfree also he knew that somewhere or other she was stillalive and needed his helphe lay back on the bed and tried to compose himselfwhat had he done how many years had he added to hisservitude by that moment of weaknessin another moment he would hear the tramp of bootsoutside they could not let such an outburst go unpunishedthey would know now if they had not known before thathe was breaking the agreement he had made with them heobeyed the party but he still hated the party in the olddays he had hidden a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity now he had retreated a step furtherin the mind he had surrendered but he had hoped to keepthe inner heart inviolate he knew that he was in the wrongbut he preferred to be in the wrong they would understandthat—obrien would understand it it was all confessed inthat single foolish cryhe would have to start all over again it might take yearshe ran a hand over his face trying to familiarize himselfwith the new shape there were deep furrows in the cheeksthe cheekbones felt sharp the nose flattened besides sincefree ebooks at planet ebookcom353last seeing himself in the glass he had been given a completenew set of teeth it was not easy to preserve inscrutability when you did not know what your face looked like inany case mere control of the features was not enough forthe first time he perceived that if you want to keep a secretyou must also hide it from yourself you must know all thewhile that it is there but until it is needed you must never letit emerge into your consciousness in any shape that couldbe given a name from now onwards he must not only thinkright he must feel right dream right and all the while hemust keep his hatred locked up inside him like a ball ofmatter which was part of himself and yet unconnected withthe rest of him a kind of cystone day they would decide to shoot him you could nottell when it would happen but a few seconds beforehandit should be possible to guess it was always from behindwalking down a corridor ten seconds would be enough inthat time the world inside him could turn over and thensuddenly without a word uttered without a check in hisstep without the changing of a line in his face—suddenlythe camouflage would be down and bang would go the batteries of his hatred hatred would fill him like an enormousroaring flame and almost in the same instant bang wouldgo the bullet too late or too early they would have blownhis brain to pieces before they could reclaim it the heretical thought would be unpunished unrepented out of theirreach for ever they would have blown a hole in their ownperfection to die hating them that was freedomhe shut his eyes it was more difficult than accepting3541984an intellectual discipline it was a question of degradinghimself mutilating himself he had got to plunge into thefilthiest of filth what was the most horrible sickening thingof all he thought of big brother the enormous face because of constantly seeing it on posters he always thoughtof it as being a metre wide with its heavy black moustacheand the eyes that followed you to and fro seemed to floatinto his mind of its own accord

airpressure the cells where the guards had beaten him werebelow ground level the room where he had been interrogated by obrien was high up near the roof this place wasmany metres underground as deep down as it was possibleto goit was bigger than most of the cells he had been in buthe hardly noticed his surroundings all he noticed was thatthere were two small tables straight in front of him eachcovered with green baize one was only a metre or twofrom him the other was further away near the door hewas strapped upright in a chair so tightly that he couldmove nothing not even his head a sort of pad gripped hishead from behind forcing him to look straight in front ofhimfor a moment he was alone then the door opened andobrien came inyou asked me once said obrien what was in room101 i

itwas saccharine flavoured with cloves the speciality of thecafewinston was listening to the telescreen at present onlymusic was coming out of it but there was a possibility thatat any moment there might be a special bulletin from theministry of peace the news from the african front was disquieting in the extreme on and off he had been worryingabout it all day a eurasian army oceania was at war

central africa for the first time in thewhole war the territory of oceania itself was menaceda violent emotion not fear exactly but a sort of undifferentiated excitement flared up in him then faded againhe stopped thinking about the war in these days he couldnever fix his mind on any one subject for more than a fewmoments at a time he picked up his glass and drained itat a gulp as always the gin made him shudder and evenretch slightly the stuff was horrible the cloves and saccharine themselves disgusting enough in their sickly waycould not disguise the flat oily smell and what was worstof all was that the smell of gin which dwelt with him nightand day was inextricably mixed up in his mind with thesmell of those——he never named them even in his thoughts and sofar as it was possible he never visualized them they weresomething that he was halfaware of hovering close to hisface a smell that clung to his nostrils as the gin rose inhim he belched through purple lips he had grown fattersince

filled it there was no need to give ordersthey knew his habits the chessboard was always waitingfor him his corner table was always reserved even when3641984the place was full he had it to himself since nobody caredto be seen sitting too close to him he never even botheredto count his drinks at irregular intervals they presentedhim with a dirty slip of paper which they said was the billbut he had the impression that they always underchargedhim it would have made no difference if it had been theother way about he had always plenty of money nowadayshe even had a job a sinecure more highlypaid than his oldjob had beenthe music from the telescreen stopped and a voice tookover winston raised his head to listen no bulletins fromthe front however it was merely a brief announcementfrom the ministry of plenty in the preceding quarter it appeared the tenth threeyear plans quota for bootlaces hadbeen overfulfilled by 98 per centhe examined the chess problem and set out the pieces itwas a tricky ending involving a couple of knights white toplay and mate in two moves winston looked up at the portrait of big brother white always mates he thought with asort of cloudy

was the bulletin from thefront instinct told him that it was bad news that was coming all day with little spurts of excitement the thoughtof a smashing defeat in africa had been in and out of hismind he seemed actually to see the eurasian army swarming across the neverbroken frontier and pouring downinto the tip of africa like a column of ants why had it notbeen possible to outflank them in some way the outline ofthe west african coast stood out vividly in his mind hepicked up the white knight and moved it across the boardthere was the proper spot even while he saw the blackhorde racing southward he saw another force mysteriouslyassembled suddenly planted in their rear cutting their comunications by land and sea he felt that by willing it hewas bringing that other force into existence but it was necessary to act quickly if they could get control of the wholeof africa if they had airfields and submarine bases at thecape it would cut oceania in two it might mean anythingdefeat breakdown the redivision of the world the destruction of the party he drew a deep breath an extraordinarymedley of feeling—but it was not a medley exactly rather itwas successive layers of feeling in which one could not saywhich layer was undermost—struggled inside himthe spasm passed he put the white knight back in itsplace but for the moment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess problem his thoughts wanderedagain almost unconsciously he traced with his finger inthe dust on the table36619842+2=5they cant get inside you she had said but they couldget inside

if either of them hadwanted to actually it was by chance that they had met itwas in the park on a vile biting day in march when theearth was like iron and all the grass seemed dead and therewas not a bud anywhere except a few crocuses which hadpushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind hewas hurrying along with frozen hands and watering eyeswhen he saw her not ten metres away from him it struckhim at once that she had changed in some illdefined waythey almost passed one another without a sign then heturned and followed her not very eagerly he knew thatthere was no danger nobody would take any interest in himshe did not speak she walked obliquely away across thegrass as though trying to get rid of him then seemed to resign herself to having him at her side presently they were

mattered they could have lain down on theground and done that if they had wanted to his fleshfroze with horror at the thought of it she made no responsewhatever to the clasp of his arm she did not even try to disengage herself he knew now what had changed in her herface was sallower and there was a long scar partly hiddenby the hair across her forehead and temple but that was notthe change it was that her waist had grown thicker and ina surprising way had stiffened he remembered how onceafter the explosion of a rocket bomb he had helped to draga corpse out of some ruins and had been astonished notonly by the incredible weight of the thing but by its rigidityand awkwardness to handle which made it seem more likestone than flesh her body felt like that it occurred to himthat the texture of her skin would be quite different fromwhat it had once beenhe did not attempt to kiss her nor did they speak as theywalked back across the grass she looked directly at him forthe first time it was only a momentary glance full of contempt and dislike he wondered whether it was a dislike thatcame purely out of the past or whether it was inspired alsoby his bloated face and the water that the wind kept squeezing from his eyes they sat down on two iron chairs side byside but not too close together he saw that she was aboutto speak she moved her clumsy shoe a few centimetres anddeliberately crushed a twig her feet seemed to have grown3681984broader he noticedi betrayed you she said baldlyi betrayed you he saidshe gave him another quick look of dislikesometimes she said

speed as tofree ebooks at planet ebookcom369prevent his keeping abreast of her he had made up his mindthat he would accompany her as far as the tube station butsuddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemedpointless and unbearable he was overwhelmed by a desirenot so much to get away from julia as to get back to thechestnut tree cafe which had never seemed so attractiveas at this moment he had a nostalgic vision of his cornertable with the newspaper and the chessboard and the everflowing gin above all it would be warm in there the nextmoment not altogether by accident he allowed himself tobecome separated from her by a small knot of people hemade a halfhearted attempt to catch up then slowed downturned and made off in the opposite direction when hehad gone fifty

admonished him occasionally perhaps twice a week he went to adusty forgottenlooking office in the ministry of truth anddid a little work or what was called work he had been appointed to a subcommittee of a subcommittee which hadsprouted from one of the innumerable committees dealingwith minor difficulties that arose in the compilation of theeleventh edition of the newspeak dictionary they wereengaged in producing something called an interim reportbut what it was that they were reporting on he had neverdefinitely found out it was something to do with the question of whether commas should be placed inside bracketsfree ebooks at planet ebookcom371or outside there were four others on the committee all ofthem persons similar to himself there were days when theyassembled and then promptly dispersed again frankly admitting to one another that there was not really anything tobe done but there were other days when they settled downto their work almost eagerly making a tremendous showof entering up their minutes and drafting long memorandawhich were never finished—when the argument as to whatthey were supposedly arguing about grew extraordinarilyinvolved and abstruse with subtle haggling over definitionsenormous digressions quarrels—threats even to appeal tohigher authority and then suddenly the life would go outof them and they would sit round the table looking at oneanother with extinct eyes like ghosts fading at cockcrowthe telescreen was silent for a moment winston raisedhis head again the bulletin but no they were merelychanging the music he had the map of

water streamed downthe windowpane and the light indoors was too dull to readby the boredom of the two children in the dark crampedbedroom became unbearable winston whined and grizzled made futile

mothersaid now be good and iil buy you a toy a lovely toy—youll love it and then she had gone out in the rain to alittle general shop which was still sporadically open nearbyand came back with a cardboard box containing an outfitof snakes and ladders he could still remember the smellof the damp cardboard it was a miserable outfit the boardwas cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so illcut thatthey would hardly lie on their sides winston looked at thething sulkily and without interest but then his mother lit apiece of candle and they sat down on the floor to play soonhe was wildly excited and shouting with laughter as the tiddlywinks climbed hopefully up the ladders and then cameslithering down the snakes again almost to the startingpoint they played eight games winning four

electric drill ran through thecafe even the waiters had started and pricked up theirearsthe trumpetcall had let loose an enormous volume ofnoise already an excited voice was gabbling from the telescreen but even as it started it was almost drowned by aroar of cheering from outside the news had run round thestreets like magic he could hear just enough of what wasissuing from the telescreen to realize that it had all happened as he had foreseen a vast seaborne armada hadsecretly assembled a sudden blow in the enemys rear thewhite arrow tearing across the tail of the black fragmentsof

but in his mindhe was running swiftly running he was with the crowdsoutside cheering himself deaf he looked up again at theportrait of big brother the colossus that bestrode theworld the rock against which the hordes of asia dashedthemselves in vain he thought how ten minutes ago—yesonly ten minutes—there had still been equivocation inhis heart as he wondered whether the news from the frontwould be of victory or defeat ah it was more than a eurasian army that had perished much had changed in himsince that first day in the ministry of love but the final indispensable healing change had never

it wasall right everything was all right the struggle was finishedhe had won the victory over himself he loved big brotherthe endappendixthe principles of newspeaknewspeak was the official language of oceania andhad been devised to meet the ideological needs of ingsocor english socialism in the year 1984 there was not as yetanyone who used newspeak as his sole means of communication either in speech or writing the leading articlesin the times were written in it but this was a tour deforce which could only be carried out by a specialist itwas expected that newspeak would have finally superseded oldspeak or standard english as we should call it byabout the year 2050 meanwhile it gained ground steadily all party members tending to use newspeak words andgrammatical constructions more and more in their everyday speech the version in use in 1984 and embodied in theninth and tenth editions of the newspeak dictionary wasa provisional one and contained many superfluous wordsand archaic formations which were due to be suppressedlater it is with the final perfected version as embodied inthe eleventh edition of the dictionary that we are concerned herethe purpose of newspeak was not only to provide a3761984medium of expression for the worldview and mental habits proper to the devotees of ingsoc but to make all othermodes of thought impossible it was intended that whennewspeak had been adopted once and for all and oldspeakforgotten a heretical thought—that is a thought divergingfrom the principles of ingsoc—should be literally unthinkable at least so far as thought is dependent on words itsvocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a partymember could properly wish to express while excludingall other meanings and also the possibility of arriving atthem by indirect methods this was done partly by theinvention of new words but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words and by stripping such words as remained ofunorthodox meanings and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever to give a single example the wordfree still existed in newspeak but it could only be used insuch statements as this dog is free from lice or this fieldis free from weeds it could not be used in its old sense ofpolitically free or intellectually free since political and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts andwere therefore of necessity nameless quite apart from thesuppression of definitely heretical words reduction of vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself and no word thatcould be dispensed with was allowed to survive newspeakwas designed not to extend but to diminish the range ofthought and this purpose was indirectly assisted by cuttingthe choice of words down to a minimumnewspeak was founded on the english language as wefree ebooks at planet ebookcom377now know it though many newspeak sentences even whennot containing newlycreated words would be barely intelligible to an englishspeaker of our own day newspeakwords were divided into three distinct classes known asthe a vocabulary the b vocabulary also called compoundwords and the c vocabulary it will be simpler to discusseach class separately but the grammatical peculiarities ofthe language can be dealt with in the section devoted to thea vocabulary since the same rules held good for all threecategoriesthe a vocabulary the a vocabulary consistedof the words needed for the business of everyday life—forsuch things as eating drinking working putting on onesclothes going up and down stairs riding in vehicles gardening cooking and the like it was composed almost entirelyof words that we already possess words like hit rundog tree sugar house field—but in comparison with the presentday english vocabulary their numberwas extremely small while their meanings were far morerigidly defined all ambiguities and shades of meaning hadbeen purged out of them so far as it could be achieved anewspeak word of this class was simply a staccato soundexpressing one clearly understood concept it would havebeen quite impossible to use the a vocabulary for literarypurposes or for political or philosophical discussion it wasintended only to express simple purposive thoughts usually involving concrete objects or physical actionsthe grammar of newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities the first of these was an almost complete3781984interchangeability between different parts of speech anyword in the language in principle this applied even to veryabstract words such as if or when could be used eitheras verb noun adjective or adverb between the verb andthe noun form when they were of the same root there wasnever any variation this rule of itself involving the destruction of many archaic forms the word thoughtfor example did not exist in newspeak its place was taken by think which did duty for both noun and verb noetymological principle was followed here in some cases itwas the original noun that was chosen for retention in other cases the verb even where a noun and verb of kindredmeaning were not etymologically connected one or otherof them was frequently suppressed there was for exampleno such word as cut its meaning being sufficiently covered by the nounverb knife adjectives were formed byadding the suffix ful to the nounverb and adverbs byadding wise thus for example speedful meant rapidand speedwise meant quickly certain of our presentday adjectives such as good strong big blacksoft were retained but their total number was very smallthere was little need for them since almost any adjectivalmeaning could be arrived at by adding ful to a nounverbnone of the nowexisting adverbs was retained except for avery few already ending in wise the wise terminationwas invariable the word well for example was replacedby goodwisein addition any word—this again applied in principleto every word in the language—could be negatived by addfree ebooks at planet ebookcom379ing the affix un or could be strengthened by the affixplus or for still greater emphasis doubleplus thusfor example uncold meant warm while pluscoldand doublepluscold meant respectively very coldand superlatively cold it was also possible as in presentday english to modify the meaning of almost any word byprepositional affixes such as ante post up downetc by such methods it was found possible to bring aboutan enormous diminution of vocabulary given for instancethe word good there was no need for such a word as badsince the required meaning was equally well—indeed better—expressed by ungood all that was necessary inany case where two words formed a natural pair of opposites was to decide which of them to suppress dark forexample could be replaced by unlight or light byundark according to preferencethe second distinguishing mark of newspeak grammar was its regularity subject to a few exceptions whichare mentioned below all inflexions followed the same rulesthus in all verbs the preterite and the past participle werethe same and ended in ed the preterite of steal wasstealed the preterite of think was thinked andso on throughout the language all such forms as swamgave brought spoke taken etc being abolishedall plurals were made by adding s or es as the case mightbe the plurals of man ox life were mans oxeslifes comparison of adjectives was invariably made byadding er est good gooder goodest irregular forms and the more most formation being3801984suppressedthe only classes of words that were still allowed to inflectirregularly were the pronouns the relatives the demonstrative adjectives and the auxiliary verbs all of these followedtheir ancient usage except that whom had been scrappedas unnecessary and the shall should tenses had beendropped all their uses being covered by will and wouldthere were also certain irregularities in wordformationarising out of the need for rapid and easy speech a wordwhich was difficult to utter or was liable to be incorrectlyheard was held to be ipso facto a bad word occasionallytherefore for the sake of euphony extra letters were inserted into a word or an archaic formation was retained butthis need made itself felt chiefly in connexion with the bvocabulary why so great an importance was attached toease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essaythe b vocabulary the b vocabulary consisted ofwords which had been deliberately constructed for politicalpurposes words that is to say which not only had in everycase a political implication but were intended to imposea desirable mental attitude upon the person using themwithout a full understanding of the principles of ingsocit was difficult to use these words correctly in some casesthey could be translated into oldspeak or even into wordstaken from the a vocabulary but this usually demandeda long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certainovertones the b words were a sort of verbal shorthand often packing whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables andat the same time more accurate and forcible than ordinaryfree ebooks at planet ebookcom381languagethe b words were in all cases compound words compound words such as speakwrite were of course to befound in the a vocabulary but these were merely convenientabbreviations and had no special ideologcal colour theyconsisted of two or more words or portions of words welded together in an easily pronounceable form the resultingamalgam was always a nounverb and inflected accordingto the ordinary rules to take a single example the wordgoodthink meaning very roughly orthodoxy or ifone chose to regard it as a verb to think in an orthodoxmanner this inflected as follows nounverb goodthink past tense and past participle goodthinkedpresent participle goodthinking adjective goodthinkful adverb goodthinkwise verbal noungoodthinkerthe b words were not constructed on any etymologicalplan the words of which they were made up could be anyparts of speech and could be placed in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronounce whileindicating their derivation in the word crimethinkthoughtcrime for instance the think came secondwhereas in thinkpol thought police it came firstand in the latter word police had lost its second syllablebecause of the great difficulty in securing euphony irregular formations were commoner in the b vocabulary thanin the a vocabulary for example the adjective forms ofminitrue minipax and miniluv were respectivelyminitruthful minipeaceful and minilovely3821984simply because trueful paxful and lovefulwere slightly awkward to pronounce in principle howeverall b words could inflect and all inflected in exactly thesame waysome of the b words had highly subtilized meaningsbarely intelligible to anyone who had not mastered thelanguage as a whole consider for example such a typicalsentence from a times leading article as oldthinkersunbellyfeel ingsoc the shortest rendering that onecould make of this in oldspeak would be those whoseideas were formed before the revolution can not have a fullemotional understanding of the principles of english socialism but this is not an adequate translation to beginwith in order to grasp the full meaning of the newspeaksentence quoted above one would have to have a clear ideaof what is meant by ingsoc and in addition only a person thoroughly grounded in ingsoc could appreciate thefull force of the word bellyfeel which implied a blindenthusiastic acceptance difficult to imagine today or of theword oldthink which was inextricably mixed up withthe idea of wickedness and decadence but the special function of certain newspeak words of which oldthinkwas one was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them these words necessarily few in number hadhad their meanings extended until they contained withinthemselves whole batteries of words which as they weresufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term couldnow be scrapped and forgotten the greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the newspeak dictionary was not tofree ebooks at planet ebookcom383invent new words but having invented them to make surewhat they meant to make sure that is to say what ranges ofwords they cancelled by their existenceas we have already seen in the case of the word freewords which had once borne a heretical meaning weresometimes retained for the sake of convenience but onlywith the undesirable meanings purged out of them countless other words such as honour justice moralityinternationalism democracy science andreligion had simply ceased to exist a few blanket wordscovered them and in covering them abolished them allwords grouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality for instance were contained in the singleword crimethink while all words grouping themselvesround the concepts of objectivity and rationalism werecontained in the single word oldthink greater precision would have been dangerous what was required in aparty member was an outlook similar to that of the ancienthebrew who knew without knowing much else that all nations other than his own worshipped false gods he didnot need to know that these gods were called baal osirismoloch ashtaroth and the like probably the less he knewabout them the better for his orthodoxy he knew jehovahand the commandments of jehovah he knew thereforethat all gods with other names or other attributes were falsegods in somewhat the same way the party member knewwhat constituted right conduct and in exceedingly vaguegeneralized terms he knew what kinds of departure fromit were possible his sexual life for example was entirely3841984regulated by the two newspeak words sexcrime sexual immorality and goodsex chastity sexcrimecovered all sexual misdeeds whatever it covered fornication adultery homosexuality and other perversions andin addition normal intercourse practised for its own sakethere was no need to enumerate them separately since theywere all equally culpable and in principle all punishableby death in the c vocabulary which consisted of scientificand technical words it might be necessary to give specialized names to certain sexual aberrations but the ordinarycitizen had no need of them he knew what was meant bygoodsex—that is to say normal intercourse betweenman and wife for the sole purpose of begetting childrenand without physical pleasure on the part of the woman allelse was sexcrime in newspeak it was seldom possible tofollow a heretical thought further than the perception thatit was heretical beyond that point the necessary wordswere nonexistentno word in the b vocabulary was ideologically neutrala great many were euphemisms such words for instanceas joycamp forcedlabour camp or minipax ministry of peace ie ministry of war meant almost the exactopposite of what they appeared to mean some words onthe other hand displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of oceanic society anexample was prolefeed meaning the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the party handed outto the masses other words again were ambivalent having the connotation good when applied to the party andfree ebooks at planet ebookcom385bad when applied to its enemies but in addition there weregreat numbers of words which at first sight appeared to bemere abbreviations and which derived their ideological colour not from their meaning but from their structureso far as it could be contrived everything that had ormight have political significance of any kind was fitted intothe b vocabulary the name of every organization or bodyof people or doctrine or country or institution or publicbuilding was invariably cut down into the familiar shapethat is a single easily pronounced word with the smallestnumber of syllables that would preserve the original derivation in the ministry of truth for example the recordsdepartment in which winston smith worked was calledrecdep the fiction department was called ficdep theteleprogrammes department was called teledep and soon this was not done solely with the object of saving timeeven in the early decades of the twentieth century telescoped words and phrases had been one of the characteristicfeatures of political language and it had been noticed thatthe tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was mostmarked in totalitarian countries and totalitarian organizations examples were such words as nazi gestapocomintern inprecorr agitprop in the beginning the practice had been adopted as it were instinctivelybut in newspeak it was used with a conscious purpose itwas perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning by cutting out most ofthe associations that would otherwise cling to it the wordscommunist international for instance call up3861984a composite picture of universal human brotherhood redflags barricades karl marx and the paris commune theword comintern on the other hand suggests merely atightlyknit organization and a welldefined body of doctrine it refers to something almost as easily recognizedand as limited in purpose as a chair or a table comintern is a word that can be uttered almost without takingthought whereas communist international isa phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily in the same way the associations called up by aword like minitrue are fewer and more controllable thanthose called up by ministry of truth this accountednot only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible butalso for the almost exaggerated care that was taken to makeevery word easily pronounceablein newspeak euphony outweighed every considerationother than exactitude of meaning regularity of grammarwas always sacrificed to it when it seemed necessary andrightly so since what was required above all for politicalpurposes was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which could be uttered rapidly and which roused theminimum of echoes in the speakers mind the words of theb vocabulary even gained in force from the fact that nearlyall of them were very much alike almost invariably thesewords—goodthink minipax prolefeed sexcrime joycamp ingsoc bellyfeel thinkpoland countless others—were words of two or three syllableswith the stress distributed equally between the first syllableand the last the use of them encouraged a gabbling style offree ebooks at planet ebookcom387speech at once staccato and monotonous and this was exactly what was aimed at the intention was to make speechand especially speech on any subject not ideologically neutral as nearly as possible independent of consciousness forthe purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary orsometimes necessary to reflect before speaking but a partymember called upon to make a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the correct opinions asautomatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets histraining fitted him to do this the language gave him an almost foolproof instrument and the texture of the wordswith their harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness whichwas in accord with the spirit of ingsoc assisted the processstill furtherso did the fact of having very few words to choose fromrelative to our own the newspeak vocabulary was tinyand new ways of reducing it were constantly being devisednewspeak indeed differed from most all other languagesin that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger everyyear each reduction was a gain since the smaller the areaof choice the smaller the temptation to take thought ultimately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue fromthe larynx without involving the higher brain centres atall this aim was frankly admitted in the newspeak wordduckspeak meaning to quack like a duck like variousother words in the b vocabulary duckspeak was ambivalent in meaning provided that the opinions which werequacked out were orthodox ones it implied nothing butpraise and when the times referred to one of the orators3881984of the party as a doubleplusgood duckspeaker itwas paying a warm and valued complimentthe c vocabulary the c vocabulary was supplementary to the others and consisted entirely of scientificand technical terms these resembled the scientific termsin use today and were constructed from the same roots butthe usual care was taken to define them rigidly and stripthem of undesirable meanings they followed the samegrammatical rules as the words in the other two vocabularies very few of the c words had any currency either ineveryday speech or in political speech any scientific worker or technician could find all the words he needed in thelist devoted to his own speciality but he seldom had morethan a smattering of the words occurring in the other listsonly a very few words were common to all lists and therewas no vocabulary expressing the function of science as ahabit of mind or a method of thought irrespective of itsparticular branches there was indeed no word for science any meaning that it could possibly bear being alreadysufficiently covered by the word ingsocfrom the foregoing account it will be seen that in newspeak the expression of unorthodox opinions above a verylow level was wellnigh impossible it was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind a species ofblasphemy it would have been possible for example to saybig brother is ungood but this statement whichto an orthodox ear merely conveyed a selfevident absurdity could not have been sustained by reasoned argumentbecause the necessary words were not available ideas inimfree ebooks at planet ebookcom389ical to ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordlessform and could only be named in very broad terms whichlumped together and condemned whole groups of heresieswithout defining them in doing so one could in fact onlyuse newspeak for unorthodox purposes by illegitimatelytranslating some of the words back into oldspeak for example all mans are equal was a possible newspeaksentence but only in the same sense in which all menare redhaired is a possible oldspeak sentence it didnot contain a grammatical error but it expressed a palpable untruth—ie that all men are of equal size weight orstrength the concept of political equality no longer existedand this secondary meaning had accordingly been purgedout of the word equal in 1984 when oldspeak was stillthe normal means of communication the danger theoretically existed that in using newspeak words one mightremember their original meanings in practice it was notdifficult for any person well grounded in doublethinkto avoid doing this but within a couple of generations eventhe possibility of such a lapse would have vaished a person growing up with newspeak as his sole language wouldno more know that equal had once had the secondary meaning of politically equal or that free had oncemeant intellectually free than for instance a person whohad never heard of chess would be aware of the secondarymeanings attaching to queen and rook there wouldbe many crimes and errors which it would be beyond hispower to commit simply because they were nameless andtherefore unimaginable and it was to be foreseen that with3901984the passage of time the distinguishing characteristics ofnewspeak would become more and more pronounced—itswords growing fewer and fewer their meanings more andmore rigid and the chance of putting them to improperuses always diminishingwhen oldspeak had been once and for all supersededthe last link with the past would have been severed historyhad already been rewritten but fragments of the literatureof the past survived here and there imperfectly censoredand so long as one retained ones knowledge of oldspeakit was possible to read them in the future such fragmentseven if they chanced to survive would be unintelligibleand untranslatable it was impossible to translate any passage of oldspeak into newspeak unless it either referred tosome technical process or some very simple everyday action or was already orthodox goodthinkful wouldbe the newspeak expression in tendency in practice thismeant that no book written before approximately 1960could be translated as a whole prerevolutionary literaturecould only be subjected to ideological translation—that isalteration in sense as well as language take for examplethe wellknown passage from the declaration of independencewe hold these truths to be selfevidentthat all men are created equal that theyare endowed by their creator with certaininalienable rights that among these arelife liberty and the pursuit of happinessfree ebooks at planet ebookcom391that to secure these rights governments areinstituted among men deriving their powersfrom the consent of the governed thatwhenever any form of government becomesdestructive of those ends it is the right of thepeople to alter or abolish it and to institutenew governmentit would have been quite impossible to render this intonewspeak while keeping to the sense of the original thenearest one could come to doing so would be to swallow thewhole passage up in the single word crimethink a fulltranslation could only be an ideological translation whereby jeffersons words would be changed into a panegyric onabsolute governmenta good deal of the literature of the past was indeed already being transformed in this way considerations ofprestige made it desirable to preserve the memory of certain historical figures while at the same time bringingtheir achievements into line with the philosophy of ingsocvarious writers such as shakespeare milton swift byron dickens and some others were therefore in process oftranslation when the task had been completed their original writings with all else that survived of the literatureof the past would be destroyed these translations werea slow and difficult business and it was not expected thatthey would be finished before the first or second decade ofthe twentyfirst century there were also large quantities ofmerely utilitarian literature—indispensable technical man3921984uals and the like—that had to be treated in the same way itwas chiefly in order to allow time for the preliminary workof translation that the final adoption of newspeak had beenfixed for so late a date as 2050free ebooks at planet ebookcom393\n"
